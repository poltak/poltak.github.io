# About me

Hi there üñêÔ∏è I'm Jon.

I've been hooked on computers and software since I was a kid, thanks to video games. I started coding at 12 by tweaking Doom 3 configs to customize the game. My problem-solving skills were honed early as the go-to tech support for friends and family, mastering admin tasks on Windows XP before diving into the world of Linux. I spent countless hours breaking and fixing computers, always trying to install some Linux variant on every machine I could find‚Äîmuch to my friends' and family's frustration.

Fast forward to now, and I‚Äôve got almost 10 years of professional experience as a remote software developer. Software is still a huge passion of mine, and I‚Äôm constantly learning and evolving in this field. It's a journey I‚Äôm excited to continue for years to come.
