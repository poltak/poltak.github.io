# About me

Hi there 🖐️ I'm Jon.

I've been hooked on computers and software since I was a kid, starting with a classic obsession: video games. I caught the bug at 12 when I realized I could tweak Doom 3 configs to bend the game to my will. That spark turned into a lifelong habit of breaking, fixing, and over-optimizing everything I touched. I became the go-to tech support for anyone within earshot, mastering Windows XP admin tasks before falling down the Linux rabbit hole. I’ve spent more hours than I can count installing Linux distros on every piece of hardware I could find - much to the frustration of my friends and family.

Fast forward to today, and I’ve spent over a decade as a professional remote software developer. Software isn't just a career for me; it’s a craft I’m still obsessed with. I’m constantly evolving, tinkering, and remolding myself to work with different technologies and constraints. It's been a hell of a journey so far, and I’m just getting started.
