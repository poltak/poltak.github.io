title: About me
---

I am currently a student doing my Honours Degree[^1] of Bachelor of Computer Science at Monash University, Melbourne,
Australia. During my undergraduate degree, I majored in Systems Development, which involves a lot of the coursework from the
Bachelor of Software Engineering degree at Monash.

## Research interests

I am currently working on a project looking at


## Human language interests

Apart from the fields of computer science and software engineering, my academic interests include human languages and
world history, both particularly in the East and South East Asian regions. Human languages I have studied include:

- Japanese (high school study)
- Indonesian (informal study)
- Cantonese (informal study)
- Mandarin (tertiary study)

Mandarin is the language that currently I am focussing a lot of my time into, and plan to move to Taipei, Taiwan at the end of
2014 for further language study at the [Mandarin Training Center][1] at the [National Taiwan Normal University][2]. In
preparation for this, I am currently trying to relearn the 400 or so Simplified Chinese characters that I am familiar with
in Traditional Chinese.

I am currently using [Skritter][4] on my iPad to learn to read, write, and recognise both Simplified and Traditional
Chinese characters. [Pleco][5] is my go to Chinese dictionary, which integrates well into Skritter.

I also plan to find some time in the near future to sit down and learn the [Korean writing system][3]. Although I have
no experience with the spoken language, I find the premise behind the writing system fascinating and it seems to be very
logical in comparison to [Hanzi][7] and the Japanese writing systems of [Hiragana][8] and [Katakana][9] (in fact, there
is no real difference behind the mechanisms underlying those two writing systems).

For anyone interested in learning more about Chinese language and culture, I suggest diving deep into the history of the
region with Laszlo Montgomery's riveting [China History Podcast][6].





[^1]: For those unaware, honours in Australia is essentially an extension of an undergraduate bachelors degree with a major focus on research. Honours students are expected to produce a thesis containing the results of their research over the period of a year. Often, students and their honours supervisors will attempt to get their theses published in academic journals and/or conferences.
