I am currently a student doing my Honours Degree[^1] of Bachelor of Computer Science at Monash University, Melbourne,
Australia. During my undergraduate degree, I majored in Systems Development, which involves a lot of the coursework from the
Bachelor of Software Engineering degree at Monash.

I am also working on a startup I recently co-founded, TeamFusian, where we are
currently focusing on mobile and web app development. We are currently
developing a card game for web, iOS, and Android platforms, written using the
brilliant multi-platform [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) framework. We are aiming to market and release the game
initially in South East Asian and Middle Eastern markets.

I will (hopefully) graduate from my current degree by August, 2015, and am
planning to further explore the space of tech startups once I complete.
Currently, I am thinking to move to either Chiang Mai, Thailand, or Hanoi,
Vietnam to look at startups in these areas. My rationale behind this thinking is
that I am still young, and hence am not subject to such responsibilities as
a family, and very much eager to gain more experience through such adventures (failure is very much a welcome option, as long
as it presents experience and personal growth :) ).

## Research interests

My research interests are in the area of big data processing and handling. Currently, we are at a stage where we are
generating an exponentially large amount of data at a faster rate than technology can keep up with. What this means
practically is that it is infeasible to store all this data. Instead, a hot topic in big data is realtime processing of
streams of incoming data. I am currently researching better methods of processing this incoming data in realtime, and
also finding the best ways of processing those data depending on their characteristics.

As a side, I am also interested in the NoSQL/non-relational space of databases.
As part of a small research project, I am currently working on the design and
implementation of my own NoSQL key-value store database, affectionately known as
"LockerDB". The (WIP) project can be found on [my github repo](https://github.com/poltak/LockerDB).

## Human language interests

Apart from the fields of computer science and software engineering, my academic interests include human languages and
world history, both particularly in the East and South East Asian regions. Human languages I have studied include:

- Mandarin (tertiary study)
- Japanese (high school study)
- Indonesian (informal study)
- Cantonese (informal study)

I am also currently looking into Vietnamese.

Mandarin is the language that currently I am focussing a lot of my time into. From November 2014 to March 2015, I lived
in Taipei, Taiwan (Republic of China) for further intensive Chinese language study
at the [Mandarin Training Center][1] at [National Taiwan Normal University][2].

I am currently using [Skritter][4] on my iPhone to learn to read, write, and recognise both Simplified and Traditional
Chinese characters. [Pleco][5] is my go to Chinese dictionary, which integrates well into Skritter.

I also plan to find some time in the near future to sit down and learn the Korean writing system, [Hangul][3]. Although I have
no experience with the spoken language, I find the premise behind the writing system fascinating and it seems to be very
logical in comparison to the Chinese wrting system, [Hanzi][7], and the Japanese writing systems
of [Hiragana][8] and [Katakana][9] (in fact, there
is no real difference behind the mechanisms underlying those two writing systems).

For anyone interested in learning more about Chinese language and culture, I suggest diving deep into the history of the
region with Laszlo Montgomery's riveting [China History Podcast][6].





[^1]: For those unaware, honours in Australia is essentially an extension of an undergraduate bachelors degree with a major focus on research. Honours students are expected to produce a thesis containing the results of their research over the period of a year. Often, students and their honours supervisors will attempt to get their theses published in academic journals and/or conferences.
