I am currently a software developer working on some projects, one launched ([WhichTeam](http://which-team.com/)), living in Danang, Vietnam. I
specialise in backend development, mobile app development, and am more recently working with a lot of newer front-end web technologies, such as React, redux, and webpack.

I have been working on WhichTeam for almost a year now, and recently been working on a newer project SkillUp, which is an educational technology.

Previously, I was a student doing my Honours Degree[^1] of Bachelor of Computer Science at Monash University, Melbourne,
Australia. My research topic was big data processing in realtime, using newer
technologies, such as [Storm](https://storm.apache.org/), [Spark Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/streaming/), and [Samza](https://samza.apache.org).
I graduated with the award of first class honours, and my graduate thesis is
[publicly available](https://github.com/poltak/honours-thesis/raw/master/thesis.pdf), on GitHub, for those who may be interested.

I also recently managed to publish [an article](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050916307116) in [Procedia Computer Science](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/procedia-computer-science) based upon my thesis work. This was presented at the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS) in San Diego, this year.

During my undergraduate degree, I majored in Systems Development, which involves a lot of the coursework from the
Bachelor of Software Engineering degree at Monash.

## Research interests

My research interests are in the area of big data processing and handling. Currently, we are at a stage where we are
generating an exponentially large amount of data at a faster rate than technology can keep up with. What this means
practically is that it is infeasible to store all this data. Instead, a hot topic in big data is realtime processing of
streams of incoming data. I was previously researching better methods of processing this incoming data in realtime, and
also finding the best ways of processing those data depending on their characteristics.

## Human language interests

Apart from the fields of computer science and software engineering, my academic interests include human languages and
world history, both particularly in the East and South East Asian regions. Human languages I have studied include:

- Mandarin (tertiary study)
- Japanese (high school study)
- Indonesian (informal study)
- Cantonese (informal study)
- Vietnamese (informal study)


Mandarin is the language that currently I am focussing a lot of my time into. From November 2014 to March 2015, I lived
in Taipei, Taiwan (Republic of China) for further intensive Chinese language study
at the [Mandarin Training Center][1] at [National Taiwan Normal University][2].

I am currently using [Skritter][4] on my iPhone to learn to read, write, and recognise both Simplified and Traditional
Chinese characters. [Pleco][5] is my go to Chinese dictionary, which integrates well into Skritter.

I also plan to find some time in the near future to sit down and learn the Korean writing system, [Hangul][3]. Although I have
no experience with the spoken language, I find the premise behind the writing system fascinating and it seems to be very
logical in comparison to the Chinese wrting system, [Hanzi][7], and the Japanese writing systems
of [Hiragana][8] and [Katakana][9] (in fact, there
is no real difference behind the mechanisms underlying those two writing systems).

For anyone interested in learning more about Chinese language and culture, I suggest diving deep into the history of the
region with Laszlo Montgomery's riveting [China History Podcast][6].





[^1]: For those unaware, honours in Australia is essentially an extension of an undergraduate bachelors degree with a major focus on research. Honours students are expected to produce a thesis containing the results of their research over the period of a year. Often, students and their honours supervisors will attempt to get their theses published in academic journals and/or conferences.
