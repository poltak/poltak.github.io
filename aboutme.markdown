## Who am I?

I am an Australian software developer, currently living in Danang, Vietnam. I work in a number of technologies,
mainly focused around web/mobile-app and static website development. I also dabble in backend programming and devops
in a number of projects I work on.

I have recently been working on [the WhichTeam App](http://which-team.com/), which I co-founded in 2015. WhichTeam provides
an online space for football fans to discuss and vote on upcoming match results. We are mainly targetting the French audience,
but have significantly sized groups of users in African countries, South East Asian countries, and other European countries.
More recently, I have been planning a new venture, _testmate_, which is an educational technology aimed at the Vietnamese
audience.

Apart from sitting in front of my laptop, I spend a lot of the time exploring the beautiful central Vietnamese countryside
on my motorbike. If you're ever in the area, feel free to contact me. I also spend a lot of time reading (mainly fiction)
and studying (mainly languages).

Previously, I was a student doing my Honours Degree[^1] of Bachelor of Computer Science at Monash University, Melbourne,
Australia. My research topic was big data processing in realtime, using newer
technologies, such as [Storm](https://storm.apache.org/), [Spark Streaming](https://spark.apache.org/streaming/), and [Samza](https://samza.apache.org).
I graduated with the award of first class honours, and my graduate thesis is
[publicly available on GitHub](https://github.com/poltak/honours-thesis/raw/master/thesis.pdf), in draft, for those who may be interested.

I also recently managed to publish [an article](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050916307116) in
[Procedia Computer Science](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/procedia-computer-science) based upon my thesis work.
This was presented at the International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS) in San Diego, this year.

During my undergraduate degree, I majored in Systems Development, which involves a lot of the coursework from the
Bachelor of Software Engineering degree at Monash.

## Research interests

My research interests are in the area of big data processing and handling. As an undergrad and postgrad research student,
my research was all concerned with big data processing, but more specifically real-time processing. I worked at applying
real-time processing concepts using technologies available to different use-cases in the domains of health-care (USA) and
the railway industry (Aus).

At the time this was a relatively new area of study and the technologies (Spark, Storm, Samza)
were very immature. Much more progress has been made in the last few years since then, however I am no longer following
a path in academia. Maybe one day...

## Human language interests

Apart from the fields of computer science and software engineering, one of my major interests is human languages.
Languages that I have studied seriously:

- Mandarin (tertiary study)
- Japanese (high school study)
- Indonesian (informal study)
- Cantonese (informal study)
- Vietnamese (informal study)

Vietnamese is the language that currently I am focusing a lot of my time into, as I live in Vietnam. I have lived in
Vietnam since November 2015, spending most of my time in central Vietnam and a few months in the north. I am studying
Vietnamese focusing on the northern accent and vocab, and it is a huge degree more difficult than any other language
that I have studied. That being said, I am making progress (very slowly in comparison to other languages, like Mandarin).

From November 2014 to March 2015, and then from July to November, I lived in Taipei, Taiwan (Republic of China) for
intensive Chinese language study at the [Mandarin Training Center][1] at [National Taiwan Normal University][2]. Within
about 3 months, I was having conversations in Mandarin with people I met in the streets of Taipei. This course is highly
recommended for anyone interested in the Mandarin language, however was quite serious.

I like to use a software to attempt to mitigate the boredom that comes from the more repetitive parts of language learning.
For vocab memorisation, I find [Anki][10] to be fantastic. I keep personal deck of Vietnamese words which I add to whenever
I learn something new ([available here][11]). [Memrise][12] is a similar tool with user-created content, but I find has a less-than-ideal
flashcard testing algorithm and worse content (but there is some good stuff!). Of course, while many people hate it because
they don't _get_ the silly sample sentences, I find [Duolingo][13] a pretty fun way to be introduced to new vocab, sentence
structures, and grammar (if they have your target language).

[Skritter][4] is great for learners of Mandarin and Japanese to practice reading, writing, and recognising both Simplified
and Traditional Chinese characters on your smart phone. I used it for a while, but ended my subscription recently as I don't have enough time
to study Chinese at present. [Pleco][5] is my go to Chinese dictionary, which integrates well with Skritter.

[^1]: For those unaware, honours in Australia is essentially an extension of an undergraduate bachelors degree with a major focus on research. Honours students are expected to produce a thesis containing the results of their research over the period of a year. Often, students and their honours supervisors will attempt to get their theses published in academic journals and/or conferences.
