I caught the bug at 12 when I realized I could tweak Doom 3 configs to bend the game to my will. That spark turned into a lifelong habit of breaking, fixing, and over-optimizing everything I touched. I became the go-to tech support for anyone within earshot, mastering Windows XP admin tasks before falling down the Linux rabbit hole. I’ve spent more hours than I can count installing Linux distros on every piece of hardware I could find - much to the frustration of my friends and family.</p> <p class="svelte-1m5j4hb">Fast forward to today, and I’ve spent over a decade as a professional remote software developer. Software isn’t just a career for me; it’s a craft I’m still obsessed with. I’m constantly evolving, tinkering, and remolding myself to work with different technologies and constraints. It’s been a hell of a journey so far, and I’m just getting started.</p> <p class="svelte-1m5j4hb">I recently set up a Kindle highlights browser. You can <a href="/fun/kindle-highlights-viewer?source=site">browse my personal Kindle clippings</a> if you’re curious about what I’ve read over the years. I stopped using a Kindle ~1 year ago for reading, in favour of an iPad Mini, so these are currently static until I figure out how to incorporate my highlights from there.</p>',1);function l(e){var t=i();n(8),a(e,t)}export{l as component};
