I caught the bug at 12 when I realized I could tweak Doom 3 configs to bend the game to my will. That spark turned into a lifelong habit of breaking, fixing, and over-optimizing everything I touched. I became the go-to tech support for anyone within earshot, mastering Windows XP admin tasks before falling down the Linux rabbit hole. I’ve spent more hours than I can count installing various Linux distros on every piece of hardware I could find—often to the mild annoyance of friends and family.</p> <p class="svelte-1wv2f82">Fast forward to today, and I’ve spent nearly a decade as a professional remote software developer. Software isn’t just a career for me; it’s a craft I’m still obsessed with. I’m constantly evolving, tinkering, and exploring the next layer of the stack. It’s been a hell of a journey so far, and I’m just getting started.</p>',1);function d(e){var t=s();n(6),o(e,t)}export{d as component};
