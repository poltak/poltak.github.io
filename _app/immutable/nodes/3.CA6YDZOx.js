I started coding at 12 by tweaking Doom 3 configs to customize the game. My problem-solving skills were honed early as the go-to tech support for friends and family, mastering admin tasks on Windows XP before diving into the world of Linux. I spent countless hours breaking and fixing computers, always trying to install some Linux variant on every machine I could find—much to my friends’ and family’s frustration.</p> <p class="svelte-1wv2f82">Fast forward to now, and I’ve got almost 10 years of professional experience as a remote software developer. Software is still a huge passion of mine, and I’m constantly learning and evolving in this field. It’s a journey I’m excited to continue for years to come.</p>',1);function l(e){var o=s();n(6),t(e,o)}export{l as component};
