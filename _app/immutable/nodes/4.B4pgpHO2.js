I caught the bug at 12 when I realized I could tweak Doom 3 configs to bend the game to my will. That spark turned into a lifelong habit of breaking, fixing, and over-optimizing everything I touched. I became the go-to tech support for anyone within earshot, mastering Windows XP admin tasks before falling down the Linux rabbit hole.

Software isn’t just a career for me; it’s a craft I’m still obsessed with. I’m constantly evolving, tinkering, and remolding myself to work with different technologies and constraints.
