And paradoxically, just because this Space is absolutely unlike and absolutely uncontaminated by its contents, it is absolutely identified with them. I don’t believe this, I see it. The Space is the things that occupy it. This Stillness-Silence is the motions and the sounds of which it is the background. As something I am merely that thing, as no-thing I am all things.

Where there are rocks, watch out, because the rocks are going eventually to come alive and they are going to have people crawling over them. It is only a matter of time, just in the same way the acorn is eventually going to turn into the oak because it has the potentiality of that within it. Watch out, because rocks are not dead.

People, who by various methods become fully aware of their floodlight consciousness, have what is called “a mystical experience,” or what the Buddhists call bodhi, an awakening. The Hindus call it moksha, or liberation, because they discover that the real deep, deep self, that which you really are fundamentally and forever, is the whole of being—all that there is, the works, that is you.

The second theory of nature is an East Indian theory. Nature is seen not as an artifact but as drama. Basic to all Hindu thought is the idea that the world is maya, a Sanskrit word which means many things. It means magic, illusion, art, and play. All the world is a stage, and in the Hindu idea of nature the ultimate reality of the universe is the self which they call brahman, or atman.

Nature, human nature included, is an organism; and an organism is a system of orderly anarchy. There is no boss in it but it gets along by being left alone and being allowed to do its stuff. That is what the Chinese Taoist philosophy calls wu-wei, which does not mean doing nothing. It means not interfering with the course of events and not acting against the grain.

the idea of li, of natural order, is like the patterns in seafoam, patterns in jade, the shapes of the clouds, the forms of trees and mountains. They are orderly, but we cannot put our finger on the order. We know it is orderly but we do not know why. The order of nature is in that way indefinable.

The feeling of Lao-tzu is that the emperor or the president should have the same kind of attitude. He should simply help the people and retire, not claiming any merits for his work, and withdraw behind the scenes. He should not strive for power, but simply help things along. “Govern a great state,” Lao-tzu said, “as you would cook a small fish.”

All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, but if the only reason Jack plays is so that he can work better afterwards, he is not really playing. He is playing because it is good for him, and that is not playing at all. To be able to be true scholars we have to cultivate an attitude in life in which we are not trying to get anything out of it. If you pick up a pebble on the beach and look at it, it is beautiful, but do not try to get a sermon out of it. Sermons-in-stones and God-in-everything be damned—just enjoy it! Do not feel that you have got to salve your conscience by saying that this is for the advancement of your aesthetic understanding. Enjoy the pebble. If you do that, you become healthy. You do not have to do anything but it is a great idea, and it is a great experience if you can learn what the Chinese call “purposelessness.” They think that nature is quite purposeless. However, when we say something is purposeless, it is a put-down. To us this means there is no future in it and it is a washout, but when the Chinese Taoists hear the word purposeless they think that is just great. It is like the waves washing against the shore, going on and on, forever with no meaning. A great Zen master said just before he died, “From the bathtub, to the bathtub, I have uttered stuff and nonsense.” The bathtub in which the baby is washed at birth, the bathtub in which the corpse is washed before burial, all this time I have said much nonsense. The birds in the trees go twee, twee, twee. What is it all about? Everybody tries to say, “Ah, yes, it is a mating call—and quite purposeful.

When you think a bit about what people really want to do with their time, and you ask what they do when they are not being pushed around or somebody is telling them what to do, you find they like to make rhythms. They listen to music and they dance or they sing, or perhaps they do something of a rhythmic nature like playing cards, bowling, or raising their elbows.

It is not until months or years later that we realize the true value of the previous work we have done.

While the microbes ferment the substrate, enzymes produced by the yeast cleave sucrose into glucose and fructose and convert these monomers into ethanol and carbon dioxide. Next, bacterial enzymes oxidize ethanol, generating acetic acid that results in an low pH environment. The bacteria also produce cellulose which leads to biofilm formation

During kombucha fermentation, it was shown that the concentration of polyphenols first decreases and then spikes at day 12, leading to higher levels of polyphenols than were originally in the solution, possibly due to the release of additional catechins or enzymes by cell lysis (Jayabalan, Marimuthu & Swaminathan, 2007).

There’s an idea in philosophy that certain things don’t exist until they get a name. Abstract things like justice, nostalgia, infinity, love, or sin. The thinking goes that these concepts do not sit out there on some ethereal plane waiting to be discovered by humans but instead snap into being when someone invents a name for them.

If an animal can beat us at a cognitive task—like how certain bird species can remember the precise locations of thousands of seeds—they write it off as instinct, not intelligence. This and so many more tricks of language are what de Waal has termed “linguistic castration.” The way we use our tongues to disempower animals, the way we invent words to maintain our spot at the top. My dad won’t give up the word “fish.” He says he likes it too much. He understands that it’s scientifically inaccurate, but he finds it useful. When I ask him if he cares that in using it he is imprisoning himself in a limited way of experiencing the world, he groans and says, “Eh. I’m too old to be freed of anything I haven’t already been freed from.” My oldest sister had no problem letting go of the fish. She let the whole category slide right out of her hand.

No support, in other words, for the primate origins of human war. Given that a common ancestor eventually evolved into humans, chimps, and bonobos, basic scientific and journalistic principles would seem to require that the bonobos’ deeply antiwar ethos would get as much attention from serious authors as accounts of chimpanzee brutality.

When things are going wrong, when multiple problems are occurring all at once, when things get overwhelming, you have to prioritize and execute. Take a step back. Detach from the mayhem. Look at the situation and assess the multitude of problems, tasks, or issues. Choose the one that is going to have the biggest impact and execute on that. If you try to solve every problem or complete every task simultaneously, you will fail at all of them. Pick the biggest problem or the issue that will provide the most positive impact. Then focus your resources on that and attack it. Get it taken care of. Once you have done that, you can move on to the next problem or issue, then the one after that.

The more we understand what human life was like before agriculture, the more civilization looks like a pyramid scheme. Disparities of wealth and power were among the first things to emerge when people settled into villages and towns. Someone had to make decisions about who got how much of what, and when. Someone had to organize the sowing and the reaping, the protection and trading of land and livestock. Once wealth emerged, so did an elite class that was naturally tempted to benefit further from their privileged position.

I’m not saying I’d rather be homeless than wealthy or that there’s no substantive difference in life satisfaction between the two situations. But I am arguing that being wealthy isn’t what it’s cracked up to be—not nearly so—and that those who spend their lives chasing wealth that they think will bring them happiness are trapped running on the same wheel as everybody else. A wealthy friend of mine recently told me, “You get successful by saying ‘yes,’ but you need to say ‘no’ a lot to stay successful.” If you’re perceived to be wealthier than those around you, you’ll have to say “no” a lot. You’ll be constantly approached with requests, offers, pitches, and pleas—whether you’re in a Starbucks in Silicon Valley or the back streets of Calcutta. Refusing sincere requests for help doesn’t come naturally to our species.

A so-called progressive agenda often aligns with forager values: a more equitable distribution of resources, assistance for the vulnerable, respect and autonomy for women (including equal pay and reproductive rights), increased funding for health care and educational programs, acceptance of all religions, and so on. A more conservative agenda often aligns with such agricultural values as individual rights superseding those of the community, paternalistic male control over women’s sexual behavior, expansionist militarism, exaltation of wealth, and monotheism. It may seem far-fetched to link a very contemporary company like Kickstarter with hunter-gatherers, but Johnson would agree that there’s a direct connection: “There is something in the collaborative, egalitarian structure of these systems that resonates with the human mind, an echo of our deep history as a species.… The social architectures of the Paleolithic era—the human mind’s formative years—were much closer to peer networks than they were to states or corporations.” This kind of egalitarian, horizontal network is made possible by the internet and its associated gadgetry. The potential implications are exciting and include voting and campaign contributions via smartphone, more dispersed independent publishing and journalism, crypto-banking and currency exchange, rapid response disaster relief organizations, remote medicine, and inexpensive education.

People, especially young people, think that freedom is to do just what they want, that in Zen there is no need for rules. But it is absolutely necessary for us to have some rules. But this does not mean always to be under control. As long as you have rules, you have a chance for freedom. To try to obtain freedom without being aware of the rules means nothing.

    When the alarm rings early in the morning, and you get up, I think you do not feel so good. It is not easy to go and sit, and even after you arrive at the zendo and begin zazen you have to encourage yourself to sit well. These are just waves of your mind. In pure zazen there should not be any waves in your mind. While you are sitting these waves will become smaller and smaller, and your effort will change into some subtle feeling.

If you think the aim of Zen practice is to train you to become one of the best horses, you will have a big problem. This is not the right understanding. If you practice Zen in the right way it does not matter whether you are the best horse or the worst one. When you consider the mercy of Buddha, how do you think Buddha will feel about the four kinds of horses? He will have more sympathy for the worst one than for the best one.

    I think we naturally need some way of life as a group and as Zen students in America, and as Hyakujo established our way of monastic life in China, I think we must establish an American way of Zen life. I am not saying this jokingly, I am pretty serious. But I do not want to be too serious. If we become too serious we will lose our way.

We cannot force anything. But once the rules have been decided, we should obey them completely until they are changed. It is not a matter of good or bad, convenient or inconvenient. You just do it without question. That way your mind is free. The important thing is to obey your rules without discrimination.

You establish a particular relationship with the objects on your desk, the items on your kitchen counter, the things in your bedroom.

HOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT The 1st Law: Make It Obvious 1.1: Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them. 1.2: Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].” 1.3: Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].” 1.4: Design your environment.

the brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules for behavior, and when it comes across an exaggerated version of that rule, it lights up like a Christmas tree. Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality—like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual.

For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary movement. When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.

FIGURE 9: Before a habit is learned (A), dopamine is released when the reward is experienced for the first time. The next time around (B), dopamine rises before taking action, immediately after a cue is recognized. This spike leads to a feeling of desire and a craving to take action whenever the cue is spotted. Once a habit is learned, dopamine will not rise when a reward is experienced because you already expect the reward. However, if you see a cue and expect a reward, but do not get one, then dopamine will drop in disappointment (C). The sensitivity of the dopamine response can clearly be seen when a reward is provided late (D).

The difficulty is not so much in the language as in the thought-patterns which have hitherto seemed inseparable from the academic and scientific way of approaching a subject. The unsuitability of these patterns for such subjects as Taoism and Zen is largely responsible for the impression that the “Oriental mind” is mysterious, irrational, and inscrutable.

We learn, very thoroughly though far less explicitly, to identify ourselves with an equally conventional view of “myself.” For the conventional “self” or “person” is composed mainly of a history consisting of selected memories, and beginning from the moment of parturition. According to convention, I am not simply what I am doing now. I am also what I have done, and my conventionally edited version of my past is made to seem almost more the real “me” than what I am at this moment.

Hui-neng’s teaching is that instead of trying to purify or empty the mind, one must simply let go of the mind–because the mind is nothing to be grasped. Letting go of the mind is also equivalent to letting go of the series of thoughts and impressions (nien) which come and go “in” the mind, neither repressing them, holding them, nor interfering with them.

He was glad she had that, at least; he was grateful that she could drink. The years immediately following the end of the Second World War were the best years of his teaching; and they were in some ways the happiest years of his life. Veterans of that war descended upon the campus and transformed it, bringing to it a quality of life it had not had before, an intensity and turbulence that amounted to a transformation. He worked harder than he had ever worked; the students, strange in their maturity, were intensely serious and contemptuous of triviality.

Man’s identification with his idea of himself gives him a specious and precarious sense of permanence. For this idea is relatively fixed, being based upon carefully selected memories of his past, memories which have a preserved and fixed character. Social convention encourages the fixity of the idea because the very usefulness of symbols depends upon their stability. Convention therefore encourages him to associate his idea of himself with equally abstract and symbolic roles and stereotypes, since these will help him to form an idea of himself which will be definite and intelligible. But to the degree that he identifies himself with the fixed idea, he becomes aware of “life” as something which flows past him–faster and faster as he grows older, as his idea becomes more rigid, more bolstered with memories. The more he attempts to clutch the world, the more he feels it as a process in motion.

The difficulty of Zen is, of course, to shift one’s attention from the abstract to the concrete, from the symbolic self to one’s true nature. So long as we merely talk about it, so long as we turn over ideas in our minds about “symbol” and “reality,” or keep repeating, “I am not my idea of myself,” this is still mere abstractíon. Zen created the method (upaya) of “direct pointing” in order to escape from this vicious circle, in order to thrust the real immediately to our notice.

In its stress upon naturalness, Zen is obviously the inheritor of Taoism, and its view of spontaneous action as “marvelous activity” (miao-yung d) is precisely what the Taoists meant by the word te–“virtue” with an overtone of magical power. But neither in Taoism nor in Zen does it have anything to do with magic in the merely sensational sense of performing superhuman “miracles.” The “magical” or “marvelous” quality of spontaneous action is, on the contrary, that it is perfectly human, and yet shows no sign of being contrived.

to make a mechanical system more and more automatic will require the use of a series of feed-back systems–a second to correct the first, a third to correct the second, and so on. But there are obvious limits to such a series, for beyond a certain point the mechanism will be “frustrated” by its own complexity. For example, it might take so long for the information to pass through the series of control systems that it would arrive at the original machine too late to be useful. Similarly, when human beings think too carefully and minutely about an action to be taken, they cannot make up their minds in time to act.

For to the extent that the upper and lower limits coincide, the signals for switching off and switching on will coincide! If 70 degrees is both the lower and upper limit the “go” sign will also be the “stop” sign; “yes” will imply “no” and “no” will imply “yes.” Whereupon the mechanism will start “trembling,” going on and off, on and off, until it shakes itself to pieces. The system is too sensitive and shows symptoms which are startlingly like human anxiety. For when a human being is so self-conscious, so self-controlled that he cannot let go of himself, he dithers or wobbles between opposites. This is precisely what is meant in Zen by going round and round on “the wheel of birth-and-death,” for the Buddhist samsara is the prototype of all vicious circles.

We saw that when the furnace responds too closely to the thermostat, it cannot go ahead without also trying to stop, or stop without also trying to go ahead. This is just what happens to the human being, to the mind, when the desire for certainty and security prompts identification between the mind and its own image of itself. It cannot let go of itself. It feels that it should not do what it is doing, and that it should do what it is not doing. It feels that it should not be what it is, and be what it isn’t. Furthermore, the effort to remain always “good” or “happy” is like trying to hold the thermostat to a constant 70 degrees by making the lower limit the same as the upper.

In the end, the only alternative to a shuddering paralysis is to leap into action regardless of the consequences. Action in this spirit may be right or wrong with respect to conventional standards. But our decisions upon the conventional level must be supported by the conviction that whatever we do, and whatever “happens” to us, is ultimately “right.” In other words, we must enter into it without “second thought,” without the arrière-pensée of regret, hesitancy, doubt, or self-recrimination.

Social conditioning fosters the identification of the mind with a fixed idea of itself as the means of self-control, and as a result man thinks of himself as “I”–the ego. Thereupon the mental center of gravity shifts from the spontaneous or original mind to the ego image. Once this has happened, the very center of our psychic life is identified with the self-controlling mechanism. It then becomes almost impossible to see how “I” can let go of “myself,” for I am precisely my habitual effort to hold on to myself.

There’s nothing controversial about this process of respiration and the role of carbon dioxide in gas exchange. It’s basic biochemistry. What’s less acknowledged is the role carbon dioxide plays in weight loss. That carbon dioxide in every exhale has weight, and we exhale more weight than we inhale. And the way the body loses weight isn’t through profusely sweating or “burning it off.” We lose weight through exhaled breath.

It’s much more common, especially in the modern world, to never experience full-blown, life-threatening stress, but to never fully relax either. We’ll spend our days half-asleep and nights half-awake, lolling in a gray zone of half-anxiety. When we do, the vagus nerve stays half-stimulated. During these times, the organs throughout the body won’t be “shut down,” but will instead be half supported in a state of suspended animation: blood flow will decrease and communication between the organs and the brain will become choppy, like a conversation through a staticky phone line. Our bodies can persist like this for a while; they can keep us alive, but they can’t keep us healthy.

Take a very deep breath into the pit of your stomach and let it back out just as quickly. Keep breathing this way for 30 cycles. If possible, breathe through the nose; if the nose feels obstructed, try pursed lips. Each breath should look like a wave, with the inhale inflating the stomach, then the chest.

For the past few months, as part as his NIH research, Feinstein has brought in patients suffering with anxiety and panic to this lab and given them a few hits of carbon dioxide. So far, he tells me, the results have been promising. Sure, the gas elicited a panic attack in most patients, but this is all part of the baptism-by-fire process. After that initial bout of discomfort, many patients report feeling relaxed for hours, even days.

I take in a breath of room air, push out an exhale. This requires some effort. The red button is switched off; I’m no longer breathing any more of the carbon dioxide mixture, but it feels like someone has jammed a sock in my mouth. I try to take another breath, but the sock keeps growing. OK, now there’s a pounding in my temples. I open my eyes to check my levels, but the room is blurry. A few seconds later, I’m viewing the world through what looks like cracked and dirty binoculars. I can’t breathe. Every sense feels as if it’s being torn from my control, vacuumed out. Maybe 10 or 20 seconds pass before the sock shrinks, there’s a cooling at the back of my neck, and the whirlpool of anxiety reverses and floats off. The color and clarity of my vision ripples outward, like a hand clearing mist from a window. Feinstein stands a few feet from me, staring. It all comes back to life. I can breathe again.

Receptive plant roots produce plumes of volatile compounds that drift through the soil and cause spores to sprout and hyphae to branch and grow faster. Fungi produce plant growth hormones that manipulate roots, causing them to proliferate into masses of feathery branches—with a greater surface area, the chances of an encounter between root tips and fungal hyphae become more likely. (Many fungi produce plant and animal hormones to alter the physiology of their associates.)

Fungi release chemicals that suspend their plant partners’ immune responses, without which they can’t get close enough to form symbiotic structures. Once established, mycorrhizal partnerships continue to develop. Connections between hyphae and roots are dynamic, formed and reformed as root tips and fungal hyphae get old and die.

Some fungi grow adhesive nets, or branches to which nematodes stick. Some use mechanical means, producing hyphal nooses that inflate in a tenth of a second when touched, ensnaring their prey. Some—including the commonly cultivated oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus)—produce hyphal stalks capped with a single toxic droplet that paralyzes nematodes, giving the hypha enough time to grow through their mouth and digest the worm from the inside. Others produce spores that can swim through the soil, chemically drawn toward nematodes, to which they bind. Once attached, the spores sprout and the fungus harpoons the worm with specialized hyphae known as “gun cells.” Fungal

Their evolutionary lineages forked, like the branches of a tree. The trunk of the tree forked into branches, which forked into smaller branches, which forked into twigs. Species were the leaves on the twigs of the tree of life. However, the dual hypothesis suggested that lichens were bodies composed of organisms with quite different origins.

These subsurface worlds are as diverse as the Amazon rainforest and contain billions of tons of microbes, hundreds of times the collective weight of all the humans on the planet.

Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, which organizes its life around carpenter ants. Once infected by the fungus, ants are stripped of their instinctive fear of heights, leave the relative safety of their nests, and climb up the nearest plant—a syndrome known as “summit disease.” In due course the fungus forces the ant to clamp its jaws around the plant in a “death grip.” Mycelium grows from the ant’s feet and stitches them to the plant’s surface. The fungus then digests the ant’s body and sprouts a stalk out of its head, from which spores shower down on ants passing below. If the spores miss their targets, they produce secondary sticky spores that extend outward on threads that act like trip wires.

Once inside the body, psilocybin is converted to the chemical psilocin. Psilocin slips into the workings of the brain by stimulating receptors normally stimulated by the neurotransmitter serotonin. By mimicking one of our most widely used chemical messengers, psilocybin, like LSD, infiltrates our nervous systems, intervenes directly in the passage of electrical signals around our bodies, and can even change the growth and structure of neurons.

Mycorrhizal fungi deploy acids and high pressure to burrow into solid rock. With their help, plants in the Devonian period were able to mine minerals like calcium and silica. Once unlocked, these minerals react with carbon dioxide, pulling it out of the atmosphere. The resulting compounds—carbonates and silicates—find their way into the oceans where they are used by marine organisms to make their shells. When the organisms die, the shells sink and pile up hundreds of meters thick on the ocean floor, which becomes an enormous burial ground for carbon. Add all of this up and climates start to change.

The basic idea is simple. Mycelium weaves itself into a dense fabric. The living mycelium is then dried into a dead material. The final product depends on how the mycelium is encouraged to grow. The bricks and packaging material are formed as mycelium “runs” through a slurry of damp sawdust packed into molds. The flexible materials are made from pure mycelium. Tan it, and you get leather. Dry it, and you get a foam that can be used to make anything from insoles for sports shoes to dock floats.

Today, the study of shared mycorrhizal networks is one of the fields most commonly beset with political baggage. Some portray these systems as a form of socialism by which the wealth of the forest can be redistributed. Others take inspiration from mammalian family structures and parental care, with young trees nourished by their fungal connections to older and larger “mother trees.” Some describe networks in terms of “biological markets,” in which plants and fungi are portrayed as rational economic individuals trading on the floor of an ecological stock exchange, engaging in “sanctions,” “strategic trading investments,” and “market gains.”

About ten million years ago, the enzyme our bodies use to detoxify alcohol, known as alcohol dehydrogenase, or ADH4, underwent a single mutation that left it forty times more efficient. The mutation occurred in the last common ancestor we shared with gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos. Without a modified ADH4, even small quantities of alcohol are poisonous. With a modified ADH4, alcohol can be consumed safely and used by our bodies as a source of energy.

This signal causes the roots to release chemicals into the gaps between neurons, called synapses.

Pavlov won a Nobel Prize for discovering this effect, which became known as Pavlovian or classical conditioning, but he didn’t realize that he was discovering how brains predict. His dogs were not reacting to the sound by drooling. Their brains were predicting the experience of eating food and preparing their bodies in advance to consume it.

Research shows that students can learn to experience their physical sensations not as anxiety but as energized determination, and when they do, they perform better on tests. That determination seeds their brains to predict differently in the future so they can get their butterflies flying in formation. If they practice this skill enough, they can pass a test, perhaps pass their courses, and even graduate, which has a huge impact on their future earning potential.

It’s important to understand that the human brain doesn’t seem to distinguish between different sources of chronic stress. If your body budget is already depleted by the circumstances of life​—​like physical illness, financial hardship, hormone surges, or simply not sleeping or exercising enough​—​your brain becomes more vulnerable to stress of all kinds.

An especially useful feature of the mind, and one of the closest things we have to a universal mental feature, is mood​—​the general sense of feeling that comes from your body.

Affect is the source of all your joys and sorrows. It makes some things profound or sacred to you and other things trivial or vile. If you’re a religious person, affect helps you feel connected to God. If you’re a spiritual person but not necessarily religious, affect becomes the transcendent feeling of being part of something larger than yourself. If you’re a skeptic, affect is what drives your certainty that others are wrong.

You might have a single, large neuron (the detective) receiving signals from umpteen little neurons at once (the witnesses) which are firing at various rates. The large neuron doesn’t represent all of the signals from the smaller neurons. It summarizes them, or compresses them, by reducing redundancy. After compression, the large neuron can efficiently pass that summary to other neurons.

In your cerebral cortex, compression begins with small neurons that carry sense data from your eyes, ears, and other sense organs. Some of this data may already have been predicted by your brain, and some is new. The new sense data is passed by the small neurons to larger, better-connected neurons, which compress the data into summaries. Those summaries are passed to still larger, more highly connected neurons, which compress those summaries and pass them on to even larger, even more highly connected neurons.

We treat the labeled boxes as if they’re part of nature when in fact we build them. Here’s what I mean. The concept of “race” often includes physical characteristics such as skin tone. But skin tone is on a continuum, and boundaries between one set of shades and another are placed and maintained by people in a society. Some try to justify the boundaries by appealing to genetics, but while it’s true that skin tone might be heavily influenced by genes, so are eye color, ear size, and the curvature of toenails. We, as a culture, choose the features of discrimination and draw dividing lines that magnify the differences between the group we call “us” and the group we call “them.” The lines aren’t random, but they aren’t stipulated by biology either. And after the lines are drawn, people treat skin tone as a symbol for something else. That is social reality.

Forgiveness is a letting go of past suffering and betrayal, a release of the burden of pain and hate that we carry. Forgiveness honors the heart’s greatest dignity. Whenever we are lost, it brings us back to the ground of love. With forgiveness we become unwilling to attack or wish harm to another. Whenever we forgive, in small ways at home, or in great ways between nations, we free ourselves from the past.

Most of the molecules that plants produce that change animal minds start out as tools for defense: alkaloids like morphine, caffeine, and mescaline are bitter-tasting toxins meant to discourage animals from eating the plants that make them and, should the animals persist, to poison them.

while most of the psychoactive molecules plants have developed started out as poisons, they sometimes evolved into the opposite: attractants. Scientists recently discovered a handful of species that produce caffeine in their nectar, which is the last place you would expect a plant to serve up a poisonous beverage. These plants have discovered that they can attract pollinators by offering them a small shot of caffeine;

“It’s not a knock-you-on-your-ass sort of thing, not like smoking opium. In fact, a lot of people will tell you they forget that they are high. It starts with a tickling feeling in the stomach that then rises up into the shoulders and head—this feeling of just . . . joy. You feel optimistic about things; energetic but at the same time relaxed. You’ll remain functional: you won’t say anything stupid and you’ll remember everything that happens. You won’t nod out, though you will feel a strong desire to close your eyes. Any pain you have will go away; the tea will also relieve exogenously caused depression. That’s why poppy tea is served at funerals in the Middle East. It can make sadness go away.”

Remembering what Jim Hogshire had told me about the tea’s analgesic properties, I conducted an inventory of my everyday aches and pains and physical annoyances—a stiffness in the neck I’d woken with, the nasal and throat irritations of a particularly bad hay fever season, the usual dull pain in my knuckles after too many hours at the computer keyboard—and found that all these symptoms had, if not quite disappeared, then dropped beneath the threshold of my attention. They simply didn’t matter. Then I decided it would be a good idea to inventory my mood, and concluded that it was very good indeed.

His perspective felt familiar, because I had grown up with its parallel in the Vietnamese refugee community, where people dwell on their victimization by their communist enemies. The fervor of that feeling means that they find it almost impossible to consider a world that is not divided neatly into a binary: us vs. them, anti-communist vs. communist, good vs. evil, victim vs. victimizer. In such a worldview, reconciliation with the enemy is not possible. The past cannot be forgotten. The war is not over.

Cognitive psychologists sometimes talk in terms of two distinct types of consciousness: spotlight consciousness, which illuminates a single focal point of attention, making it very good for reasoning, and lantern consciousness, in which attention is less focused yet illuminates a broader field of attention. Young children tend to exhibit lantern consciousness; so do many people on psychedelics. This more diffuse form of attention lends itself to mind wandering, free association, and the making of novel connections—all of which can nourish creativity. By comparison, caffeine’s big contribution to human progress has been to intensify spotlight consciousness—the focused, linear, abstract, and efficient cognitive processing more closely associated with mental work than with play.

Tea was celebrated in China and, later, Japan not only as a promoter of wakefulness but of health, too—and with good reason. Tea was used as a mouthwash in the East long before science discovered it contains fluoride (the English would negate this advantage by adding copious amounts of sugar to their tea); tea also contains a great many vitamins and minerals—one of the highest concentrations in any plant—and prodigious quantities of polyphenols, compounds rich in antioxidants. (Tea contains more polyphenols than red wine.)

Caffeine is a tiny molecule that happens to fit snugly into an important receptor in the central nervous system, allowing it to occupy it and therefore block the neuromodulator that would normally bind to that receptor and activate it. That neuromodulator is called adenosine; caffeine, its antagonist, keeps adenosine from doing its job by getting in its way.

when caffeine beats adenosine to those receptor sites, the brain no longer receives the signal to begin turning out the mental lights. Even so, the adenosine is still circulating in your brain—in fact, its levels continue to rise—but because the receptors have been hijacked, you don’t feel its effects. Instead, you feel wide-awake and alert.

The release of dopamine is typical in drugs of abuse, and probably accounts for caffeine’s mood-enhancing qualities—the cup of optimism!—as well as the fact that it is habit-forming. Caffeine is also a vasodilator and can be mildly diuretic. It temporarily raises blood pressure and relaxes the body’s smooth muscles, which may account for coffee’s laxative effect.

“A woman ventures out into the desert and gets lost,” he began. In some versions, she gets sick and is left behind by her hunting party. “She’s in serious trouble because she’s run out of food and water. Eventually she gives up, and lies down under a bush,” to sleep and, possibly, to die. “When she wakes up, the first thing she sees is a little peyote plant. ‘Eat me,’ the plant says. She eats, is revived, and immediately understands what peyote is about, how it works to nourish and to heal. She brings it back to her people.” The predicament of the woman, abandoned and on the verge of death, is that of all Native Americans, many of whom believe, with some reason, that this cactus has saved them, whether as individuals or as a culture—but the plant as a gift from nature, rather than the chemical it contains.

The second use was collective and ceremonial: missionaries reported scenes in which whole villages would sing and dance all night long under the influence of peyote. “To the hostile eyes of priests and missionaries these ‘feasts’ were no more than drunken orgies,” Jay writes. “More sympathetic witnesses would reveal them as ritual practices of astonishing complexity, woven deep into the fabric of the participants’ lives.”

Officiated by a roadman, a drum chief, a fire chief, and a cedarman, the ceremony leaves nothing to chance, not even one’s posture: participants must sit upright and cross-legged through the night with their eyes open, staring into the fire. A crescent-shaped altar is mounded out of earth, with a large “grandfather” peyote button placed on top. Ceremonial objects, such as the gourd rattle, water drum, and staff, are always passed to the left, as is the basket of peyote buttons, which comes around several times over the course of the night; in one of the few elements of the ritual that might be called spontaneous, participants can decide for themselves how many buttons to ingest. The roadman offers prayers. Participants take turns singing songs, each one four times; the rhythm of drumming is rapid and unceasing.

In the Indigenous perspective, we are here upon Mother Earth. We feel the wind and the wind talks. The sun comes up in a certain direction and it goes down in a certain direction. And so we build an altar on the ground made from Mother Earth and in the shape of a crescent moon. And we know Grandpa Fire is going to talk to us and commune with us, so we build the fire in a prayerful manner, making offerings along the way. The four elements—the earth, the fire, the water, the air—are going to come into the ceremony at some point in time. And then there is the plant, set upon the altar.

What I found striking in Calabrese’s account is that we have in peyote a “drug” that, instead of undermining social norms, actually reinforces them. “The Native American Church arose as a revitalization movement,” he points out, “focused on personal healing, rebuilding community, harmonious family relationships, connection with the Divine, and avoidance of alcohol.” Compared to psychedelics in the West in the 1960s, peyote’s role in the Native American community is notably conservative. (Yet another reminder of the critical role of set and setting in any psychedelic experience.) The use of peyote in the Native American Church gives us a moral model of drug use.

On psilocybin or LSD, the objects of our attention are liable to come to life and transform before our eyes: a garden plant, suddenly sentient, might return our gaze, or a chair might take on a personality and turn malevolent. Very often on psychedelics, objects become something much more than themselves. They point, often to somewhere beyond the known world, to another plane of existence. And, sometimes, we can follow them there.

Weeks or even days away? All of it would feel infinitely precious and poignant.

There were two ways to cook cactus, and Taloma showed me both. The first, more painstaking method calls for cutting the spiky plant into foot-long lengths with a knife, and then systematically removing its defenses. First the spines, by cutting a tiny notch around each areole and then scooping them out, taking care to remove as little of the precious flesh as possible. Next you stand the piece of cactus on end and, using a long knife, carefully slice down the length of each rib, separating it from the woody white core, which is discarded.

Westerners today bring a lot of negative attitudes to tobacco, regarding the plant as irredeemably evil, but, as Taloma explained, that is only because white people had abused and exploited this sacred plant when they arrived in the Americas, transforming it from a sacred medicine into a lethal and addictive habit.

Most fungi produce partitions or septa along their hyphae that divide each cylinder into compartments. Each septum has a closable hole in the middle allowing cytoplasm to flow from one compartment to the next. In one group of fungi, called basidiomycetes, the septa are surrounded with caps formed from perforated membranes. These regulate the passage of organelles along the hyphae, acting as sieves through which larger structures are excluded. And, when damage occurs to one part of the colony, septa on either side of the wound are sealed by the membrane caps to localize ‘bleeding’.

Hyphae are visible as white threads when they grow in bundles (underneath a plant pot is a good place to look), but a microscope is needed to see an individual hypha or a yeast. This is the reason that we refer to fungi as microorganisms, even though their fruit bodies can be huge. Popular references to fungi as the largest and oldest organisms are based on the estimated size of mycelia of Armillaria solidipes, a ‘honey fungus’ that grows in forest soil and attacks conifers. The current champion has spread over ten square kilometres in Oregon in the last 2,400 years and may weigh as much as 35,000 tons. The largest umbrella shaped mushrooms have a cap diameter of one metre and are produced by colonies of fungi cultivated by termites in Africa and leaf-cutter ants in Central America.

Budding yeast cells come in two strains called a and α. These mating types are akin to sexes, although there is no way to tell them apart from their appearance under the microscope. The difference between a and α cells lies in the production of different chemical attractants, or pheromones, and complementary receptor molecules in their membranes. When cells of the opposite mating type detect each other’s pheromones, their surfaces bulge, make contact, and fuse to produce a larger combined cell that contains two complete sets of chromosomes. This is similar to the fertilization of an egg by a sperm in animal biology.

Sirex woodwasps and the fungus Amylostereum areolatum. Female woodwasps drill holes into the sapwood of pine trees, lay one egg at the bottom of each hole, and add spores of the fungus on top. Like the ambrosia beetles, Sirex woodwasps have special pockets for carrying fungal spores. These mycangia are close to the insect’s ovipositor, stationing them for injection into the wood along with the eggs.

Termites engage in a comparable form of fungal agriculture in Africa and Asia. Colonies of one or two million insects build mounds of mud and tend mycelia grown on macerated plant matter. Foraging termites chew and swallow grass and wood and deposit this as faeces when they return to the nest. Workers inside the nest fashion this undigested slurry into spongy masses called combs.

Foraging termites chew and swallow grass and wood and deposit this as faeces when they return to the nest. Workers inside the nest fashion this undigested slurry into spongy masses called combs. Mycelia of the symbiotic fungi decompose the plant tissues in the combs, producing sugars and proteins that nourish the colony. The fungi in these relationships are species of Termitomyces, including the West African mushroom, Termitomyces titanicus, whose enormous gilled fruit bodies have a diameter of up to a metre.

Lichens are the best-known mutualisms involving fungi. They are composite organisms consisting of a fungus and a single-celled alga or cyanobacterium. Algal and cyanobacterial partners in lichens provide the fungus with food produced by photosynthesis.

The Latin names of lichens refer to the species of fungus rather than the photosynthetic companion. This makes a lot of sense because lichens are formed by 18,000 species of ascomycetes (40 per cent of all ascomycetes) with only 150 species of green algae and bacteria. While the fungi in lichens cannot grow without their photosynthetic symbionts, the green algae and bacteria certainly thrive outside lichens.

Most lichens contain green algae, but 15 per cent of species involve cyanobacteria. In addition to the formation of sugars by photosynthesis, the cyanobacteria in lichens absorb nitrogen gas (N2) from the atmosphere to produce ammonia (NH3). The ammonia is used by the bacterium and the fungus as a source of nitrogen for the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids. This is crucial for lichens living in places where nitrogen is scarce.

Lichens reproduce by releasing spores of the fungus and rely upon young colonies of the fungus to associate with their photosynthetic partners soon after spore germination. This is only effective, of course, when the appropriate algae or cyanobacteria are prevalent in the environment.

Insect guts may seem an unlikely place for complicated symbioses, but they teem with fungi. Researchers have identified hundreds of new yeast species inside beetles and know very little about what these fungi are doing. Some of them may be commensals, benefiting from food in the host digestive system without causing any negative effects, but mutualistic interactions are probably very common too. Detrimental relationships between pathogenic fungi and plants are similarly diverse and these are the subject of Chapter 5.

forage is digested by a combination of enzymes secreted by the cow and by microorganisms inside the animal’s stomach compartments and its gut. Anaerobic fungi participate in cellulose breakdown in the rumen. When the dung is dropped on the ground, the immediate availability of oxygen stimulates the growth of ‘coprophilous’ fungi that permeate the dung and absorb nutrients from the residue of plant materials.

Rather than reproducing at the same time, different fungi produce their spores according to a programme that plays out over several days. Zygomycetes, including Pilobolus, are the first fungi to emerge from cow dung, followed by cup fungi and other ascomycetes, and mushrooms appear last. This ecological succession illustrates the complexity of the decomposition process.

Deciduous leaves are primed for breakdown by endophytes that grow inside them before leaf fall as well as by fungi that populate the leaf surface. These internal and external leaf residents are yeasts and species of filamentous ascomycetes. They do not damage the leaves until they are shed, but begin consuming sugar molecules and other simple nutrients as soon as the host defences are shut down.

Ganoderma applanatum is a white rot fungus with very striking fruit bodies. Its brackets have a brown top and smooth white underside and extend horizontally from trees like bookshelves. The lower surface is perforated with pores that are the open ends of spore-producing tubes. The pores are barely visible without a hand lens. A new layer of tubes grows on the bottom of the bracket each year and some fruit bodies live for years until the tree trunk is completely digested.

Trichophyton species are the commonest dermatophytes. In athlete’s foot their colonies grow between the toes and can spread over the skin on the top and bottom of the foot in severe cases. On the scalp, hyphae invade the hair shaft and feed on the keratin filaments. When the fungus produces its spores, the hair shaft bursts and breaks off at the base leaving a black dot in the empty follicle. Ringworm occurs on other parts of the body and all of these infections are contagious, spreading from person to person via spores.

A thirty-year experiment on the impact of mushroom picking in Switzerland showed that intensive picking had no effect on subsequent crops as long as the pickers worked from a catwalk. This indicated that mycelia can be very resilient. But because mushroom spores are dispersed by wind, the loss of the genetic diversity derived from fruit bodies in one patch might have wider consequences that are not seen in a study confined to one area. There are more immediate concerns raised by the Swiss study. When the investigators left the catwalk to pick normally, fewer mushrooms were formed in subsequent years in the trampled areas.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other yeasts obtain their energy from sugar metabolism and generate carbon dioxide and water as waste compounds when oxygen is available. This is aerobic respiration and provides the greatest energy yield from the consumption of sugars. When oxygen levels fall, or if the yeast is growing in very high concentrations of sugar, cellular metabolism is redirected to a different pathway that releases carbon dioxide and ethanol. This fermentative mechanism is less efficient than aerobic respiration and leaves a lot of ‘unburned’ calories in ethanol. This simple switch by the yeast to an inefficient burn is the foundation of the great variety of alcoholic drinks.

Yeasts associated with the harvested apples multiply in the juice for the first few days and drive the fermentation until they are overcome by the rising levels of alcohol. As the number of these pioneers declines, the community of fungi changes and Saccharomyces cerevisiae becomes the principal species. This is explained by the higher alcohol tolerance of Saccharomyces. A third blend of yeast species controls the final maturation phase of cidermaking. Similar successions of microbial communities occur in traditional fermentations that produce other alcoholic drinks. Bacteria accompany yeasts in many fermentations.

am interested in my progress, my job, my family, the little corner in which I live, in getting a better position for myself, more prestige, more power, more domination over others, and so on. I think it would be logical, wouldn’t it, to admit to ourselves that that is what most of us are primarily interested in—me first?

Some of us would say that it is wrong to be primarily interested in ourselves. But what is wrong about it except that we seldom decently, honestly, admit it? If we do, we are rather ashamed of it. So there it is—one is fundamentally interested in oneself, and for various ideological or traditional reasons one thinks it is wrong. But what one thinks is irrelevant. Why introduce the factor of its being wrong? That is an idea, a concept. What is a fact is that one is fundamentally and lastingly interested in oneself.

Satisfaction, in all sorts of ways, subtle and obvious, is what we want. When we say we want freedom, we want it because we think it may be wonderfully satisfying, and the ultimate satisfaction, of course, is this peculiar idea of self-realization.

This craving for position, for prestige, for power, to be recognized by society as being outstanding in some way, is a wish to dominate others, and this wish to dominate is a form of aggression. The saint who seeks a position in regard to his saintliness is as aggressive as the chicken pecking in the farmyard. And what is the cause of this aggressiveness? It is fear, isn’t it?

Fear is one of the greatest problems in life. A mind that is caught in fear lives in confusion, in conflict, and therefore must be violent, distorted, and aggressive. It dare not move away from its own patterns of thinking, and this breeds hypocrisy. Until we are free from fear, we may climb the highest mountain, invent every kind of God, but we will remain in darkness.

For example, the philosopher John Locke wrote in 1689 that the mind is like ‘white paper’ on to which sensory experience writes, and that that is where all our knowledge of the physical world comes from. Another empiricist metaphor was that one could read knowledge from the ‘Book of Nature’ by making observations. Either way, the discoverer of knowledge is its passive recipient, not its creator.

Experience is indeed essential to science, but its role is different from that supposed by empiricism. It is not the source from which theories are derived. Its main use is to choose between theories that have already been guessed. That is what ‘learning from experience’ is.

No one would expect to deduce the geography of Mars from a map of Earth, so why should we expect to be able to learn about physics on Mars from experiments done on Earth? Evidently, logical deduction alone would not do, because there is a logical gap: no amount of deduction applied to statements describing a set of experiences can reach a conclusion about anything other than those experiences.

one supposedly obtains ever more reliable knowledge of the future from the past, and of the general from the particular. That alleged process was called ‘inductive inference’ or ‘induction’, and the doctrine that scientific theories are obtained in that way is called inductivism. To bridge the logical gap, some inductivists imagine that there is a principle of nature – the ‘principle of induction’ – that makes inductive inferences likely to be true.

Empiricism never did achieve its aim of liberating science from authority. It denied the legitimacy of traditional authorities, and that was salutary. But unfortunately it did this by setting up two other false authorities: sensory experience and whatever fictitious process of ‘derivation’, such as induction, one imagines is used to extract theories from experience.

In psychiatry there is a certain condition known as “delusion of reprieve.” The condemned man, immediately before his execution, gets the illusion that he might be reprieved at the very last minute. We, too, clung to shreds of hope and believed to the last moment that it would not be so bad. Just the sight of the red cheeks and round faces of those prisoners was a great encouragement. Little did we know then that they formed a specially chosen elite, who for years had been the receiving squad for new transports as they rolled into the station day after day.

do the prisoners’ reactions to the singular world of the concentration camp prove that man cannot escape the influences of his surroundings? Does man have no choice of action in the face of such circumstances? We can answer these questions from experience as well as on principle. The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action. There were enough examples, often of a heroic nature, which proved that apathy could be overcome, irritability suppressed. Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress.

A creative life and a life of enjoyment are banned to him. But not only creativeness and enjoyment are meaningful. If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering.

Research work done on unemployed miners has shown that they suffer from a peculiar sort of deformed time—inner time—which is a result of their unemployed state. Prisoners, too, suffered from this strange “time-experience.” In camp, a small time unit, a day, for example, filled with hourly tortures and fatigue, appeared endless. A larger time unit, perhaps a week, seemed to pass very quickly. My comrades agreed when I said that in camp a day lasted longer than a week. How paradoxical was our time-experience!

But in robbing the present of its reality there lay a certain danger. It became easy to overlook the opportunities to make something positive of camp life, opportunities which really did exist. Regarding our “provisional existence” as unreal was in itself an important factor in causing the prisoners to lose their hold on life; everything in a way became pointless. Such people forgot that often it is just such an exceptionally diffcult external situation which gives man the opportunity to grow spiritually beyond himself. Instead of taking the camp’s diffculties as a test of their inner strength, they did not take their life seriously and despised it as something of no consequence. They preferred to close their eyes and to live in the past. Life for such people became meaningless.

Woe to him who, when the day of his dreams finally came, found it so different from all he had longed for!

logotherapy, in comparison with psychoanalysis, is a method less retrospective and less introspective. Logotherapy focuses rather on the future, that is to say, on the meanings to be fulfilled by the patient in his future. (Logotherapy, indeed, is a meaning-centered psychotherapy.) At the same time, logotherapy defocuses all the vicious-circle formations and feedback mechanisms which play such a great role in the development of neuroses. Thus, the typical self-centeredness of the neurotic is broken up instead of being continually fostered and reinforced.

In this case, it’s been pretty good at leveraging technology to boost innovation and drive fast growth in products that are knowledge and skill-​intensive, such as automobiles. We see similar patterns in other countries with large state-​owned sectors, like Indonesia, where tech start-​ups such as Go-​Jek have been pushing the frontiers of innovation in many different areas (including its own recently announced EV venture).

The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom. Now we can understand Schopenhauer when he said that mankind was apparently doomed to vacillate eternally between the two extremes of distress and boredom. In actual fact, boredom is now causing, and certainly bringing to psychiatrists, more problems to solve than distress. And these problems are growing increasingly crucial, for progressive automation will probably lead to an enormous increase in the leisure hours available to the average worker. The pity of it is that many of these will not know what to do with all their newly acquired free time.

This emphasis on responsibleness is reflected in the categorical imperative of logotherapy, which is: “Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!” It seems to me that there is nothing which would stimulate a man’s sense of responsibleness more than this maxim, which invites him to imagine first that the present is past and, second, that the past may yet be changed and amended. Such a precept confronts him with life’s finiteness as well as the finality of what he makes out of both his life and himself.

It is one of the basic tenets of logotherapy that man’s main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life.

A young physician consulted me because of his fear of perspiring. Whenever he expected an outbreak of perspiration, this anticipatory anxiety was enough to precipitate excessive sweating. In order to cut this circle formation I advised the patient, in the event that sweating should recur, to resolve deliberately to show people how much he could sweat. A week later he returned to report that whenever he met anyone who triggered his anticipatory anxiety, he said to himself, “I only sweated out a quart before, but now I’m going to pour at least ten quarts!” The result was that, after suffering from his phobia for four years, he was able, after a single session, to free himself permanently of it within one week.

Paradoxical intention can also be applied in cases of sleep disturbance. The fear of sleeplessness12 results in a hyper- intention to fall asleep, which, in turn, incapacitates the patient to do so. To overcome this particular fear, I usually advise the patient not to try to sleep but rather to try to do just the opposite, that is, to stay awake as long as possible. In other words, the hyper-intention to fall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the paradoxical intention not to fall asleep, which soon will be followed by sleep.

It’s a good start, but if you believe you’re going to see a sunrise and your strategy for achieving that goal is to begin running west, you may have some difficulty.

Lots of times our brain runs dialogues over and over again. We debate points with ourselves or try to win old arguments or settle old scores. If that happens to you, just turn down the volume. Make the voice in your head softer, farther away, and weaker. That takes care of the problem for many people. Or do you have one of those internal dialogues that’s always limiting you? Now hear it say the same things, only in a sexy voice, in an almost flirtatious tone and tempo: “You can’t do that.” How does it feel now?

No one is always depressed. Depression isn’t a permanent condition like losing a leg. It’s a state that people can pop into and out of. In fact, most people who are experiencing depression have had many happy experiences in their lives—maybe even as many or more than the average person.

It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever. “When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is ‘So it goes.’”

This strategy would be represented in the following way: Ve-Aid-Ki. You could “talk” all day to this person about why she should do something, and it’s highly unlikely you’d succeed.

the moonlight sonatas of the world don’t simply discharge our emotions; they elevate them. Also, it’s only sad music that elicits exalted states of communion and awe. Music conveying other negative emotions, such as fear and anger, produces no such effect. Even happy music produces fewer psychological rewards than sad music, concluded Sachs, Damasio, and Habibi.

The ancient Greeks called it pothos, which Plato defined as a yearning desire for something wonderful that we can’t have. Pothos was our thirst for everything good and beautiful. Humans were lowly beings imprisoned in matter, inspired by pothos to reach for a higher reality. The concept was associated with both love and death; in Greek myth, Pothos (Longing) was the brother of Himeros (Desire) and the son of Eros (Love). But because pothos had that quality of aching for the unattainable, the word was also used to describe the flowers placed on Grecian tombs.

There’s a saying in Sufism: ‘Sufism was at first heartache. Only later, it became something to write about.’ ” His answer confirms what I’d gleaned from his lectures and writings. In one of my favorite written passages, he describes longing not as an unhealthy craving, but as the feminine expression of love: “Like everything that is created, love has a dual nature, positive and negative, masculine and feminine.

Even in the healthiest relationships, the longing often returns. In these unions, you can raise children, if you want. You can share inside jokes, favorite vacation spots, mutual admiration, and a bed; you can search the streets of a brand-new city for a heating pad when you’re traveling and your partner’s back goes out. In the best relationships, you can still, every so often, go to the moon and back. But most likely, your relationship will be an asymptote of the thing you long for. As LVL says, “Those who search for intimacy with others are reacting to this longing. They think another human will fulfill them. But how many of us have actually ever been totally fulfilled by another person? Maybe for a while, but not forever. We want something more fulfilling, more intimate. We want God. But not everyone dares to go into this abyss of pain, this longing, that can take you there.”

And, in 2017, when a group of researchers led by the University of North Carolina psychologist Amelia Goranson asked people to imagine what death would feel like, they mostly described sadness, fear, and anxiety. But their studies of terminally ill patients and death row inmates found that those actually facing death are more likely to speak of meaning, connection, and love.

In Judaism, even the transition from day into night is sacred, with the holy days starting at sundown and moving into dawn—as if to say that the onset of darkness is not the tragedy we imagine, but rather the prelude to light.

Endings will give way to beginnings just as much as beginnings give way to endings. Your ancestor’s life ended, and yours could begin. Yours will come to an end, and your child’s story will take center stage. Even within the course of your life, pieces of you will constantly die off—a job will be lost, a relationship will end—and, if you’re ready, other occupations, loves, will arise in their place. What follows may or may not be “better” than what came first. But the task is not only to let the past go, but also to transform the pain of impermanence into creativity—and transcendence.

losses shape your psyche; they lay down patterns for all your interactions. If you don’t understand them and actively work to form new emotional habits, you’ll act them out again and again. They’ll wreak havoc on your relationships, and you won’t know why.

No matter how much therapeutic work you do, these may be your Achilles’ heels for life: maybe a fear of abandonment, a fear of success, a fear of failure; maybe deep-seated insecurity, rejection sensitivity, precarious masculinity, perfectionism; maybe hair-trigger rage, or a hard nub of grief you can feel like a knot protruding from your otherwise smooth skin. Even once you break free (and you can break free), these siren songs may call you back to your accustomed ways of seeing and thinking and reacting. You can learn to block your ears most of the time, but you’ll have to accept that they’re always out there singing.

The love you lost, or the love you wished for and never had: That love exists eternally. It shifts its shape, but it’s always there. The task is to recognize it in its new form.

The first five skills involve acceptance of the bitter. First, we need to acknowledge that a loss has occurred; second, to embrace the emotions that accompany it. Instead of trying to control the pain, or to distract ourselves with food, alcohol, or work, we should simply feel our hurt, sorrow, shock, anger. Third, we need to accept all our feelings, thoughts, and memories, even the unexpected and seemingly inappropriate ones, such as liberation, laughter, and relief. Fourth, we should expect that sometimes we’ll feel overwhelmed. And fifth, we should watch out for unhelpful thoughts, such as “I should be over this,” “It’s all my fault,” and “Life is unfair.”

Do you tend to get lost in thought and look through the cashier at the grocery store? Maybe you’ll start looking at them, ask about their lives. Do you tend to be fearful? Love is the antidote to fear. Fear causes you to shrink and withhold; love opens you up. Do you tend to focus on your mistakes and shortcomings? Maybe you can shift your emphasis from one true place (“I have a lot of flaws and made a lot of mistakes today”) to another true place (“I have a lot of flaws and made a lot of mistakes, and I’m also worthy, and will try again tomorrow”). Maybe you’ll start giving that second true place more airtime.

Even the sympathy cards we send deny our right to grieve, according to a study by the psychologists Birgit Koopmann-Holm and Jeanne Tsai. Compared with German cards, which feature black-and-white designs and sayings like “In deep sadness” and “Words will not lighten a heavy heart,” American cards are colorful, with cheery proclamations like “Love lives on” and “Memories will bring comfort.” Christ dies on the cross, but we focus on the birth and resurrection.

Without the global security the Americans guaranteed, global trade and global energy flows cannot continue. Seven decades’ worth of global industrialization and modernization are not simply at risk, the very pillars of civilization are cracking. In a world without stability, the questions become: Who was most dependent upon the world that was and so will fall? And who was most restrained by the old Order and so will soar?

It concerned the sale of a forest on his wife’s estate, and came from a dealer who wanted to buy that forest. This forest had to be sold; but until he was reconciled with his wife the sale was quite out of the question. What was most unpleasant was that a financial consideration would now be mixed up with the impending reconciliation. The idea that he might be biased by that consideration, might seek a reconciliation in order to sell the forest, offended him.

in particular she did not like the fact that when he was in love with her daughter he came to the house for six weeks as if waiting and looking out for something, afraid of doing them too great an honour by making an offer of marriage, and that he did not understand that, if he visited at a house where there was a marriageable girl, he ought to declare his intentions. And then suddenly he left without proposing!

‘Well, you know, in our days it is time to give up obsolete customs. After all it’s the young people who marry and not their parents, therefore they must be left to arrange matters as they think best.’ It was all very well for people who had no daughters to talk like that, but the Princess knew that intimacy might be followed by love and that her daughter might fall in love with some one who had no intention of marrying or was not fit to be her husband. And whatever people might say about the time having come when young people must arrange their future for themselves, she could not believe it any more than she could believe that loaded pistols could ever be the best toys for five-year-old children.

While it did so, it maintained the superstitions peculiar to itself:—some, like the cultivation of the Tao as a rule of life favourable to longevity, come down from the earliest times, and others which grew up during the decay of the Chou dynasty, and subsequently blossomed;—now in mystical speculation; now in the pursuits of alchemy; now in the search for the pills of immortality and the elixir vitae; now in astrological fancies; now in visions of spirits and in magical arts to control them; and finally in the terrors of its purgatory and everlasting hell. Its phases have been continually changing, and at present it attracts our notice more as a degraded adjunct of Buddhism than as a development of the speculations of Laozi and Chuang-tzŭ.

Up to its contact with Buddhism, it subsisted as an opposition to the Confucian system, which, while admitting the existence and rule of the Supreme Being, bases its teaching on the study of man’s nature and the enforcement of the duties binding on all men from the moral and social principles of their constitution.

He was thus rather more than fifty years older than Confucius. The two men seem to have met more than once, and I am inclined to think that the name Laozi, as the designation of the other, arose from Confucius’s styling him to his disciples “The Old Philosopher.” They met as heads of different schools or schemes of thought; but did not touch, so far as we know, on the comparative antiquity of their views.

‘By giving people other wants.’ ‘Now that I never could understand,’ replied Levin, hotly. ‘How will schools help the peasants to improve their material conditions? You say that schools and education will give them new wants. So much the worse, for they won’t be able to satisfy them. And in what way knowing how to add and subtract and to say the catechism will help them to improve their material condition, I never could understand! The other evening I met a woman with an infant in her arms and asked her where she was going. She replied that she had been to see the “wise woman” because her boy was fractious, and she took him to be cured. I asked her what cure the wise woman had for fractiousness. “She puts the baby on the perch among the fowls and says something.”’

The people are poor and ignorant, this we know as surely as the woman knows that the child is fractious because it cries. But why schools should cure the ills of poverty and ignorance is just as incomprehensible as why hens on their perches should cure fractiousness. What needs to be cured is their poverty.’

It was true that often when talking to the peasants, and explaining to them the advantages of the plan, Levin felt that they were only listening to the sound of his voice and were quite determined, whatever he might say, not to let themselves be taken in. He felt this especially when talking to the most intelligent of them, Rezunov, and noticing the play in his eyes, which clearly indicated his derision of Levin and a firm resolve that if anyone was taken in it should not be Rezunov.

At the end of August he heard from a servant who brought back the side-saddle that the Oblonskys had gone back to Moscow. He felt that by not having answered Dolly Oblonskaya’s letter (a rudeness he could not remember without blushing) he had burned his boats and could never visit there again. He had treated the Sviyazhskys just as badly, having left their house without saying good-bye. But neither would he ever visit them again. That made no difference to him now. The rearrangement of his farming interested him more than anything had ever done in his life

He knew what he wanted. He saw that Russia had splendid soil and splendid labourers, and that in some cases (such as that of the peasant at the halfway-house) the labourers and land produced much: but that in the majority of cases, when capital was expended in the European way, they produced little, and that this happened simply because the labourers are only willing to work and work well, in the way natural to them, and that their opposition was not accidental but permanent, being rooted in the spirit of the people.

The fact that the author of it is myself, Constantine Levin, who once went to a ball in a black tie, whom Kitty Shcherbatskaya refused, and who seems so pitiful and insignificant to himself, proves nothing. I feel sure that Franklin felt just as insignificant and distrusted himself just as I do when he remembered his past. All that does not matter. He too probably had an Agatha Mikhaylovna to whom he confided his secrets.’ With such thoughts Levin reached home when it was already dark.

Death, the inevitable end of everything, confronted him for the first time with irresistible force. And that Death which was present in this dear brother (who, waking up, moaned and by habit called indiscriminately on God and on the devil) was not so far away as it had hitherto seemed to be. It was within himself to — he felt it. If not today, then to-morrow or thirty years hence, was it not all the same? But what that inevitable Death was, he not only did not know, not only had never considered, but could not and dared not consider.

Levin was saying what of late he had really been thinking. He saw death and the approach of death in everything; but the work he had begun interested him all the more. After all, he had to live his life somehow, till death came. Everything for him was wrapped in darkness; but just because of the darkness, feeling his work to be the only thread to guide him through that darkness, he seized upon it and clung to it with all his might.

‘Well then, bring me some beef, Philip!’ ‘The beef has been eaten, and the bone was given to the dogs,’ answered Philip. Levin was so annoyed that he said crossly: ‘Something might have been left for me!’ and he felt inclined to cry. ‘Well then, draw the birds and stuff them with nettles,’ said he in a trembling voice to Philip, trying not to look at Veslovsky; ‘and ask at least for some milk for me.’

Only Anna felt sad. She knew that when Dolly was gone no one would call up in her soul the feelings which had been aroused by their meeting. To have those feelings awakened was painful, but still she knew that they were the best part of her soul, and that that part of her was rapidly being choked by the life she was leading.

The five most common desires these subjects fought include, not surprisingly, eating, sleeping, and sex. But the top five list also included desires for “taking a break from [hard] work… checking e-mail and social networking sites, surfing the web, listening to music, or watching television.” The lure of the Internet and television proved especially strong: The subjects succeeded in resisting these particularly addictive distractions only around half the time.

A now voluminous line of inquiry, initiated in a series of pioneering papers also written by Roy Baumeister, has established the following important (and at the time, unexpected) truth about willpower: You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.

You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it. Your will, in other words, is not a manifestation of your character that you can deploy without limit; it’s instead like a muscle that tires. This is why the subjects in the Hofmann and Baumeister study had such a hard time fighting desires—over time these distractions drained their finite pool of willpower until they could no longer resist.

The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.

He only knew and felt that what was happening was similar to what had happened the year before in the hotel of the provincial town on the deathbed of his brother Nicholas. Only that was sorrow and this was joy. But that sorrow and this joy were equally beyond the usual conditions of life: they were like openings in that usual life through which something higher became visible. And, as in that case, what was now being accomplished came harshly, painfully, incomprehensibly; and while watching it, the soul soared, as then, to heights it had never known before, at which reason could not keep up with it.

‘Kitty! That same Kitty with whom Vronsky was in love,’ thought Anna. ‘She whom he remembered affectionately. He regrets not having married her. And of me he thinks with hate and regrets having joined himself to me!’

When she heard that Anna had come Kitty did not wish to appear; but Dolly persuaded her. Having mustered up her courage, Kitty came in and, blushing, went up to Anna and held out her hand. ‘I am very pleased—’ she began in a trembling voice. Kitty was confused by the struggle within her between hostility toward this bad woman and a desire to be tolerant to her; but as soon as she saw Anna’s lovely and attractive face, all the hostility vanished at once.

‘Well, I am glad you are beginning to be fond of him,’ said Kitty to her husband, when with the child at her breast she had sat down in her usual place. ‘I am very glad, for I was beginning to be grieved about it. You said you felt nothing for him.’ ‘No, did I say I felt nothing? I only said I was disillusioned.’ ‘What! Disillusioned with him?’ ‘Not so much with him as with my own feeling; I had expected more. I had expected that, like a surprise, a new, pleasant feeling would awaken in me. And then, instead of that, nothing but repulsion and pity . . .

far away to the south, a gale was blowing toward them. Though it probably wouldn't reach their position for at least two days, its approach was suggested by the movement of the ice, which stretched as far as the eye could see, and for hundreds of miles beyond that. So immense was the pack, and so tight, that though the gale had not yet reached them, the distant pressure of its winds was already crushing the floes together.

Sometimes they could see as many as 200 seals from the masthead, and it was simple to harvest the number needed. Approached quietly, the seals rarely attempted to get away. Like the penguins, they were devoid of fear when on the ice since the only enemies they knew - sea leopards and killer whales - were creatures of the sea.

To the men it seemed like a heat wave; they could go aloft with bare heads and hands in reasonable comfort.

In the Antarctic, plankton—tiny one-celled plants and animals—is the basis for all life. The smallest fishes subsist on it, and they in turn become the food of larger fish, which are eaten by squids and seals and penguins, who constitute the food for killer whales, sea leopards, and giant sperm whales. The cycle of life begins with plankton, and when it is present, the other creatures of the Antarctic are never far behind

felt little nips of pressure, but nothing serious. Then at 4:45 P.M., the floes on either side of the Endurance closed in against her, and kept on closing. Every man on board stiffened, as if he himself had been touched. Several raced up the ladders onto deck. In the next instant, the deck seemed to slide away from beneath their feet as the ship rolled suddenly over to port. A second’s pause—then everything movable let go with a rush—wood, kennels, ropes, sledges, stores, dogs, and men cascaded across the deck. James was caught under two boxes of winter clothing onto which a pile-up of dogs descended in whining, howling confusion. Clouds of steam rose from the galley and the wardroom where pots of water were upset onto the fires.

Late in the evening, the men on deck saw a band of about ten emperor penguins; they waddled slowly up toward the ship, then stopped a short distance away. Emperors, singly or in pairs, were a common sight, but nobody had ever seen so large a group before. The penguins stood for a moment watching the tortured ship, then raised their heads and uttered a series of weird, mournful, dirgelike cries. It was all the more eerie because none of the men—not even the Antarctic veterans among them—had ever before heard penguins voice anything except the most elemental, croaking sorts of noises.

They realized immediately that they must be in the open ocean. Ironically, here was the moment they had dreamed of ever since the days at Ocean Camp—but the reality was vastly different from the dream. As soon as the boats emerged from the protective barrier of the pack, they were struck by the full force of the wind, and a high, breaking sea was running down from the northeast. Freezing spray burst over them as they tried to beat their way to the NNE under sail. Time after time, icy blasts whipped them across the face, and the penetrating wind seemed all the colder because of their lack of sleep. In die Docker, Orde-Lees and Kerr slumped down onto the pile of sleeping bags, miserably seasick.

But there were definite fluctuations in morale, in accordance with the weather and whether the pack was in or out. When the sun did shine, the island became a place of rugged beauty, with the sunlight shimmering off the glaciers, producing indescribably vivid colors that were constantly changing. For all the party, it was difficult to be unhappy on days like this. But most of the time the island was far from beautiful. Though the gales were fewer, there were long stretches of wet, gloomy weather, resulting in the kind of outlook Greenstreet recorded one evening: “Everyone spent the day rotting in their bags with blubber and tobacco smoke—so passes another goddam rotten day.”

absorbed in what was going on beneath him. McIlroy cut across the end of Blackboro’s foot, then peeled the skin back. Macklin glanced at Wild and saw that he never flinched. “A hard case,” Macklin thought to himself. McIlroy then asked for a pair of forceps, and Wild removed them from the boiling water. To Greenstreet they looked like a pair of tin snips. Carefully, McIlroy reached well up under the flap of skin to where the toes joined the foot. Then one at a time he cut them off. Each dropped with a metallic clatter into the empty tin can below. Next McIlroy meticulously scraped away the dead, blackened flesh, and when the wound was clean, be carefully stitched it up. Finally it was done; Blackboro’s foot had been neatly trimmed off just at the ball joint. Altogether it had taken fifty-five minutes

Once every ninety seconds or less the Caird’s sail would go slack as one of these gigantic waves loomed astern, possibly 50 feet above her, and threatening, surely, to bury her under a hundred-million tons of water. But then, by some phenomenon of buoyancy, she was lifted higher and higher up the face of the onrushing swell until she found herself, rather unexpectedly, caught in the turmoil of foam at the summit and hurtling forward. Over and over again, a thousand times each day, this drama was re-enacted. Before long, to the men on board the Caird, it lost all elements of awesomeness and they found it routine and commonplace instead, as a group of people may become inured to the perils of living in the shadow of an active volcano.

Finally the Caird rose up on a swell and her keel ground against the rocks. Shackleton jumped ashore and held her from going out. As quickly as they could, the other men scrambled after him. It was five o’clock on the tenth of May, 1916, and they were standing at last on the island from which they had sailed 522 days before. They heard a trickling sound. Only a few yards away a little stream of fresh water was running down from the glaciers high above. A moment later all six were on their knees, drinking.

Jung’s approach is what I call the bimodal philosophy of deep work. This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else. During the deep time, the bimodal worker will act monastically—seeking intense and uninterrupted concentration. During the shallow time, such focus is not prioritized. This division of time between deep and open can happen on multiple scales.

The bimodal philosophy believes that deep work can produce extreme productivity, but only if the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors to reach maximum cognitive intensity—the state in which real breakthroughs occur. This is why the minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day. To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short to count as a deep work stretch for an adherent of this approach. At the same time, the bimodal philosophy is typically deployed by people who cannot succeed in the absence of substantial commitments to non-deep pursuits. Jung, for example, needed his clinical practice to pay the bills and the Zurich coffeehouse scene to stimulate his thinking. The approach of shifting between two modes provides a way to serve both needs well. To provide a more modern example of the bimodal philosophy in action, we can once again consider Adam Grant, the Wharton Business School professor whose thoughtfulness about work habits was first introduced in Part 1. As you might recall, Grant’s schedule during his rapid rise through the professorship ranks at Wharton provides a nice bimodality case study. On the scale of the academic year, he stacked his courses into one semester, so that he could focus the other on deep work.

The rhythmic philosophy provides an interesting contrast to the bimodal philosophy. It perhaps fails to achieve the most intense levels of deep thinking sought in the daylong concentration sessions favored by the bimodalist. The trade-off, however, is that this approach works better with the reality of human nature. By supporting deep work with rock-solid routines that make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis, the rhythmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year.

Rowling’s decision to check into a luxurious hotel suite near Edinburgh Castle is an example of a curious but effective strategy in the world of deep work: the grand gesture. The concept is simple: By leveraging a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps with a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task. This boost in importance reduces your mind’s instinct to procrastinate and delivers an injection of motivation and energy.

Lead measures, on the other hand, “measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.” In the bakery example, a good lead measure might be the number of customers who receive free samples. This is a number you can directly increase by giving out more samples. As you increase this number, your lag measures will likely eventually improve as well.

In my early experiments with 4DX, I settled on a simple but effective solution for implementing this scoreboard. I took a piece of card stock and divided it into rows, one for each week of the current semester. I then labeled each row with the dates of the week and taped it to the wall next to my computer monitor (where it couldn’t be ignored). As each week progressed, I kept track of the hours spent in deep work that week with a simple tally of tick marks in that week’s row. To maximize the motivation generated by this scoreboard, whenever I reached an important milestone in an academic paper (e.g., solving a key proof), I would circle the tally mark

You could, for example, use Kreider’s approach of retreating from the world of shallow tasks altogether by hiding out in an “undisclosed location,” but this isn’t practical for most people. Instead, I want to suggest a more applicable but still quite powerful heuristic: At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning—no after-dinner e-mail check, no mental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how you’ll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely. If you need more time, then extend your workday, but once you shut down, your mind must be left free to encounter Kreider’s buttercups, stink bugs, and stars. Before describing some tactics that support this strategy, I want to first explore why a shutdown will be profitable to your ability to produce valuable output. We have, of course, Tim Kreider’s personal endorsement, but it’s worth taking the time to also understand the science behind the value of downtime. A closer examination of this literature reveals the following three possible explanations for this value. Reason #1: Downtime Aids Insights Consider the following excerpt from a 2006 paper that appeared in the journal Science: The scientific literature has emphasized the benefits of conscious deliberation in decision making for hundreds of years… The question addressed here is whether this view is justified.

Observations from experiments such as this one led Dijksterhuis and his collaborators to introduce unconscious thought theory (UTT)—an attempt to understand the different roles conscious and unconscious deliberation play in decision making. At a high level, this theory proposes that for decisions that require the application of strict rules, the conscious mind must be involved. For example, if you need to do a math calculation, only your conscious mind is able to follow the precise arithmetic rules needed for correctness. On the other hand, for decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constraints, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue.

The implication of these results is that your capacity for deep work in a given day is limited. If you’re careful about your schedule (using, for example, the type of productivity strategies described in Rule #4), you should hit your daily deep work capacity during your workday. It follows, therefore, that by evening, you’re beyond the point where you can continue to effectively work deeply. Any work you do fit into the night, therefore, won’t be the type of high-value activities that really advance your career; your efforts will instead likely be confined to low-value shallow tasks (executed at a slow, low-energy pace).

They wanted to understand what differentiated these elite memorizers from the population at large. “We found that one of the biggest differences between memory athletes and the rest of us is in a cognitive ability that’s not a direct measure of memory at all but of attention,” explained Roediger in a New York Times blog post (emphasis mine). The ability in question is called “attentional control,” and it measures the subjects’ ability to maintain their focus on essential information. A side effect of memory training, in other words, is an improvement in your general ability to concentrate. This ability can then be fruitfully applied to any task demanding deep work.

If you’re not sure how long a given activity might take, block off the expected time, then follow this with an additional block that has a split purpose. If you need more time for the preceding activity, use this additional block to keep working on it. If you finish the activity on time, however, have an alternate use already assigned for the extra block (for example, some nonurgent tasks). This allows unpredictability in your day without requiring you to keep changing your schedule on paper.

These training efforts were deployed during my last two years at MIT, while I was a postdoc starting to look for professor positions. My main tactic was to introduce artificial constraints on my schedule, so as to better approximate the more limited free time I expected as a professor. In addition to my rule about not working at night, I started to take extended lunch breaks in the middle of the day to go for a run and then eat lunch back at my apartment. I also signed a deal to write my fourth book, So Good They Can’t Ignore You, during this period—a project, of course, that soon levied its own intense demands on my time.

Assuming that you’re not someone who engages in ultrarisky behaviors like BASE jumping, motorcycle racing, or texting and driving, the odds are overwhelming that you will die as a result of one of the chronic diseases of aging that I call the Four Horsemen: heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, or type 2 diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction

Perhaps my biggest takeaway was that modern medicine does not really have a handle on when and how to treat the chronic diseases of aging that will likely kill most of us. This is in part because each of the Horsemen is intricately complex, more of a disease process than an acute illness like a common cold. The surprise is that this is actually good news for us, in a way. Each one of the Horsemen is cumulative, the product of multiple risk factors adding up and compounding over time. Many of these same individual risk factors, it turns out, are relatively easy to reduce or even eliminate

The shift from Medicine 1.0 to Medicine 2.0 was prompted in part by new technologies such as the microscope, but it was more about a new way of thinking. The foundation was laid back in 1628, when Sir Francis Bacon first articulated what we now know as the scientific method. This represented a major philosophical shift, from observing and guessing to observing, and then forming a hypothesis, which as Richard Feynman pointed out is basically a fancy word for a guess. The next step is crucial: rigorously testing that hypothesis/guess to determine whether it is correct, also known as experimenting.

One of the most potent individual genes yet discovered is related to cholesterol metabolism, glucose metabolism—and Alzheimer’s disease risk. You may have heard of this gene, which is called APOE, because of its known effect on Alzheimer’s disease risk. It codes for a protein called APOE (apolipoprotein E) that is involved in cholesterol transport and processing, and it has three variants: e2, e3, and e4. Of these, e3 is the most common by far, but having one or two copies of the e4 variant seems to multiply one’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease by a factor of between two and twelve.

The job of mTOR is basically to balance an organism’s need to grow and reproduce against the availability of nutrients. When food is plentiful, mTOR is activated and the cell (or the organism) goes into growth mode, producing new proteins and undergoing cell division, as with the ultimate goal of reproduction. When nutrients are scarce, mTOR is suppressed and cells go into a kind of “recycling” mode, breaking down cellular components and generally cleaning house

mTOR, which is actually composed of two separate complexes, called mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). The two complexes have different jobs, but (at risk of oversimplifying) the longevity-related benefits seem to result from inhibiting complex 1. Giving the drug daily, as is typically done with transplant patients, appears to inhibit both complexes, while dosing the drug briefly or cyclically inhibits mainly mTORC1, unlocking its longevity-related benefits, with fewer unwanted side effects

you eat a doughnut, for example, the body has to decide what to do with the calories in that doughnut. At the risk of oversimplifying a bit, the carbohydrate from our doughnut has two possible fates. First, it can be converted into glycogen, the storage form of glucose, suitable for use in the near term. About 75 percent of this glycogen ends up in skeletal muscle and the other 25 percent goes to the liver, although this ratio can vary. An adult male can typically store a total of about 1,600 calories worth of glycogen between these two sites, or about enough energy for two hours of vigorous endurance exercise

That decision—where to put the energy from the doughnut—is made via hormones, chief among them insulin, which is secreted by the pancreas when the body senses the presence of glucose, the final breakdown product of most carbohydrates (such as those in the doughnut). Insulin helps shuttle the glucose to where it’s needed, while maintaining glucose homeostasis.

Insulin resistance is a term that we hear a lot, but what does it really mean? Technically, it means that cells, initially muscle cells, have stopped listening to insulin’s signals, but another way to visualize it is to imagine the cell as a balloon being blown up with air. Eventually, the balloon expands to the point where it gets more difficult to force more air inside. You have to blow harder and harder. This is where insulin comes in, to help facilitate the process of blowing air into the balloon. The pancreas begins to secrete even more insulin, to try to remove excess glucose

When insulin is chronically elevated, more problems arise. Fat gain and ultimately obesity are merely one symptom of this condition, known as hyperinsulinemia. I would argue that they are hardly even the most serious symptoms: as we’ll see in the coming chapters, insulin is also a potent growth-signaling hormone that helps foster both atherosclerosis and cancer.

Lots of people like to demonize fructose, especially in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, without really understanding why it’s supposed to be so harmful. The story is complicated but fascinating. The key factor here is that fructose is metabolized in a manner different from other sugars. When we metabolize fructose, along with certain other types of foods, it produces large amounts of uric acid, which is best known as a cause of gout but which has also been associated with elevated blood pressure.

Fructose isn’t the only thing that creates uric acid; foods high in chemicals called purines, such as certain meats, cheeses, anchovies, and beer, also generate uric acid. This is why gout, a condition of excess uric acid, was so common among gluttonous aristocrats in the olden days (and still today). I test my patients’ levels of uric acid, not only because high levels may promote fat storage but also because it is linked to high blood pressure. High uric acid is an early warning sign that we need to address a patient’s metabolic health, their diet, or both.

When a brain cell, muscle cell, gut cell, or any other type of cell breaks down glucose, it will almost instantly have more ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cellular energy “currency,” at its disposal. But this energy is not free: the cell must expend a small amount of ATP in order to make more ATP, in the same way that you sometimes have to spend money to make money. In glucose metabolism, this energy expenditure is regulated by a specific enzyme that prevents the cell from “spending” too much of its ATP on metabolism. But when we metabolize fructose in large quantities, a different enzyme takes over, and this enzyme does not put the brakes on ATP “spending.”

This rapid drop in energy levels makes the cell think that we are still hungry. The mechanisms are a bit complicated, but the bottom line is that even though it is rich in energy, fructose basically tricks our metabolism into thinking that we are depleting energy—and need to take in still more food and store more energy as fat.

consuming large quantities of liquid fructose simply overwhelms the ability of the gut to handle it; the excess is shunted to the liver, where many of those calories are likely to end up as fat.

One test that I like to give patients is the oral glucose tolerance test, or OGTT, where the patient swallows ten ounces of a sickly-sweet, almost undrinkable beverage called Glucola that contains seventy-five grams of pure glucose, or about twice as much sugar as in a regular Coca-Cola.[*6] We then measure the patient’s glucose and their insulin, every thirty minutes over the next two hours. Typically, their blood glucose levels will rise, followed by a peak in insulin, but then the glucose will steadily decrease as insulin does its job and removes it from circulation. On the surface, this is fine: insulin has done its job and brought glucose under control. But the insulin in someone at the early stages of insulin resistance will rise very dramatically in the first thirty minutes and then remain elevated

Our vascular network is equally miraculous, a web of veins, arteries, and capillaries that, if stretched out and laid end to end, would wrap around the earth more than twice (about sixty thousand miles, if you’re keeping score). Each individual blood vessel is a marvel of material science and engineering, capable of expanding and contracting dozens of times per minute, allowing vital substances to pass through its membranes, and accommodating huge swings in fluid pressure, with minimal fatigue. No material created by man can even come close to matching this. If one vessel is injured, others regrow to take its place, ensuring continuous blood flow throughout the body.

Because cholesterol belongs to the lipid family (that is, fats), it is not water soluble and thus cannot dissolve in our plasma like glucose or sodium and travel freely through our circulation. So it must be carted around in tiny spherical particles called lipoproteins—the final “L” in LDL and HDL—which act like little cargo submarines. As their name suggests, these lipoproteins are part lipid (inside) and part protein (outside); the protein is essentially the vessel that allows them to travel in our plasma while carrying their water-insoluble cargo of lipids, including cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids, plus vitamins and other proteins that need to be distributed to our distant tissues

When an HDL transfers its “good cholesterol” to an LDL particle, does that cholesterol suddenly become “bad”? The answer is no—because it’s not the cholesterol per se that causes problems but the nature of the particle in which it’s transported. Each lipoprotein particle is enwrapped by one or more large molecules, called apolipoproteins, that provide structure, stability, and, most importantly solubility to the particle. HDL particles are wrapped in a type of molecule called apolipoprotein A (or apoA), while LDL is encased in apolipoprotein B (or apoB). This distinction may seem trivial, but it goes to the very root cause of atherosclerotic disease: every single lipoprotein that contributes to atherosclerosis—not only LDL but several others[*1]—carries this apoB protein signature. — Another major misconception about heart disease is that it is somehow caused by the cholesterol that we eat in our diet.

According to an analysis published in JAMA Cardiology in 2021, each standard-deviation increase in apoB raises the risk of myocardial infarction by 38 percent in patients without a history of cardiac events or a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease

And do so dramatically, not marginally or incrementally. We want it as low as possible, sooner rather than later.

We then repeat the procedure as often as every two to three years, depending on the findings from the previous colonoscopy. If a sessile (flat) polyp is found, for example, we’re inclined to do it sooner than if the endoscopist finds nothing at all. Two or three years might seem like a very short window of time to repeat such an involved procedure, but colon cancer has been documented to appear within the span of as little as six months to two years after a normal colonoscopy. Better safe than sorry.

in the early 1980s, other researchers identified the substance in the plaques as a peptide called amyloid-beta. Because it is often found at the scene of the crime, amyloid-beta was immediately suspected to be a primary cause of Alzheimer’s disease. Amyloid-beta is a by-product that is created when a normally occurring substance called amyloid precursor protein, or APP, a membrane protein that is found in neuronal synapses, is cleaved into three pieces.

Amyloid-beta is a by-product that is created when a normally occurring substance called amyloid precursor protein, or APP, a membrane protein that is found in neuronal synapses, is cleaved into three pieces. Normally, APP is split into two pieces, and everything is fine. But when APP is cut in thirds, one of the resulting fragments then becomes “misfolded,” meaning it loses its normal structure (and thus its function) and becomes chemically stickier, prone to aggregating in clumps

when someone is in ketosis, their brain relies on a mix of ketones and glucose for fuel. Studies in Alzheimer’s patients find that while their brains become less able to utilize glucose, their ability to metabolize ketones does not decline. So it may make sense to try to diversify the brain’s fuel source from only glucose to both glucose and ketones.

Sleep disruptions and poor sleep are potential drivers of increased risk of dementia. If poor sleep is accompanied by high stress and elevated cortisol levels, as in Stephanie’s case, that acts almost as a multiplier of risk, as it contributes to insulin resistance and damaging the hippocampus at the same time. Furthermore, hypercortisolemia (excess cortisol due to stress) impairs the release of melatonin, the hormone that normally signals to our brains that it is time to go to sleep (and that may also help prevent neuronal loss and cognitive impairment).

A ten-year observational study of roughly 4,500 subjects ages fifty and older found that those with low muscle mass were at 40 to 50 percent greater risk of mortality than controls, over the study period. Further analysis revealed that it’s not the mere muscle mass that matters but the strength of those muscles, their ability to generate force. It’s not enough to build up big pecs or biceps in the gym—those muscles also have to be strong. They have to be capable of creating force.

Aerobic exercise, done in a very specific way, improves our ability to utilize glucose and especially fat as fuel.

When we are exercising in zone 2, most of the work is being done by our type 1, or “slow-twitch,” muscle fibers. These are extremely dense with mitochondria and thus well-suited for slow-paced, efficient endurance work. We can go for a long time without feeling fatigued. If we pick up the pace, we begin to recruit more type 2 (“fast-twitch”) muscle fibers, which are less efficient but more forceful. They also generate more lactate in the process, because of the way they create ATP. Lactate itself is not bad; trained athletes are able to recycle it as a type of fuel.

I have one patient with type 1 diabetes, meaning he produces zero insulin, who keeps his glucose in check almost entirely by walking briskly for six to ten miles every day, and sometimes more. As he walks, his muscle cells are vacuuming glucose out of his bloodstream via NIMGU.

In epidemiology, researchers gather data on the habits of large groups of people, looking for meaningful associations or correlations with outcomes such as a cancer diagnosis, cardiovascular disease, or mortality.

The fact that it does harm most of us, if consumed in excess, is a consequence of the four points above colliding with millions of years of evolution that have optimized us to be highly efficient fat-storage vehicles. It is an unfortunate externality of its business model, sort of like with cigarettes. Tobacco manufacturers set out to make a lot of money from a plentiful agricultural commodity, but the solution they devised, the cigarette, had an unfortunate side effect: it slowly killed the customer. The elements that constitute the SAD are almost as devastating to most people as tobacco when consumed in large quantities, as intended: added sugar, highly refined carbohydrates with low fiber content, processed oils, and other very densely caloric foods. I should note that this does not mean all “processed” foods are bad. Almost everything we eat, aside from fresh vegetables, is processed to some degree. For example, cheese is a processed food, invented as a way to preserve milk, which would otherwise spoil quickly without refrigeration. What we’re really talking about, when we talk about the SAD, is junk food. The basic problem we face is that, for perhaps the first time in human history, ample calories are available to many if not most people on the planet. But evolution has not prepared us for this situation. Nature is quite happy for us to be fat and frankly doesn’t care if we get diabetes.

The SAD was not specifically intended to do harm, of course. The fact that it does harm most of us, if consumed in excess, is a consequence of the four points above colliding with millions of years of evolution that have optimized us to be highly efficient fat-storage vehicles. It is an unfortunate externality of its business model, sort of like with cigarettes. Tobacco manufacturers set out to make a lot of money from a plentiful agricultural commodity, but the solution they devised, the cigarette, had an unfortunate side effect: it slowly killed the customer. The elements that constitute the SAD are almost as devastating to most people as tobacco when consumed in large quantities, as intended: added sugar, highly refined carbohydrates with low fiber content, processed oils, and other very densely caloric foods. I should note that this does not mean all “processed” foods are bad. Almost everything we eat, aside from fresh vegetables, is processed to some degree. For example, cheese is a processed food, invented as a way to preserve milk, which would otherwise spoil quickly without refrigeration. What we’re really talking about, when we talk about the SAD, is junk food. The basic problem we face is that, for perhaps the first time in human history, ample calories are available to many if not most people on the planet. But evolution has not prepared us for this situation. Nature

Even going vegan is not enough to free you from the clutches of the SAD. It is our default food environment, occupying the middle of the grocery store: the boxed and frozen and bagged bounty of an agricultural system that produces subsidized corn, flour, sugar, and soybeans by the megaton. On one level, it’s brilliant, a solution to four problems that have plagued humanity since the beginning: (1) how to produce enough food to feed almost everyone; (2) how to do so inexpensively; (3) how to preserve that food so it can be stored and transported safely; and (4) how to make it highly palatable.

The leading source of calories that Americans consume is a category called “grain-based desserts,” like pies, cakes, and cookies, according to the US Department of Agriculture. That is our number one “food group.” If we consume a bunch of grain-based desserts in a Cheesecake Factory binge, our blood glucose levels will surge. And if we do it over and over and over again, as we saw in previous chapters, we will eventually overwhelm our ability to handle all those calories in a safe way.

Once you strip away the labels and the ideology, almost all diets rely on at least one of the following three strategies to accomplish this: CALORIC RESTRICTION, or CR: eating less in total, but without attention to what is being eaten or when it’s being eaten DIETARY RESTRICTION, or DR: eating less of some particular element(s) within the diet (e.g., meat, sugar, fats) TIME RESTRICTION, or TR: restricting eating to certain times, up to and including multiday fasting

what do these two monkey studies have to tell us about nutritional biochemistry? Avoiding diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction—especially by eliminating or reducing junk food—is very important to longevity. There appears to be a strong link between calories and cancer, the leading cause of death in the control monkeys in both studies. The CR monkeys had a 50 percent lower incidence of cancer. The quality of the food you eat could be as important as the quantity. If you’re eating the SAD, then you should eat much less of it. Conversely, if your diet is high quality to begin with, and you are metabolically healthy, then only a slight degree of caloric restriction—or simply not eating to excess—can still be beneficial.

Carbohydrates are our primary energy source. In digestion, most carbohydrates are broken down to glucose, which is consumed by all cells to create energy in the form of ATP. Excess glucose, beyond what we need immediately, can be stored in the liver or muscles as glycogen for near-term use or socked away in adipose tissue (or other places) as fat. This decision is made with the help of the hormone insulin, which surges in response to the increase in blood glucose.

seemingly “healthy” meals, for example certain kinds of vegetarian tacos, can also send glucose levels soaring in some people but not others. It also depends on when those carbs are eaten. If you eat 150 grams of carbohydrates as a serving of rice and beans in one sitting, that has a different effect than eating the same amount of rice and beans spread out over the day (and, obviously, much different from ingesting 150 grams of carbs in the form of Frosted MiniWheats). Also, everyone tends to be more insulin sensitive in the morning than in the evening, so it makes sense to front-load our carb consumption earlier in the day

Another surprising thing I’ve learned thanks to CGM is about what happens to a patient’s glucose levels during the night. If she goes to bed at, say, 80 mg/dL, but then her glucose ramps up to 110 for most of the night, that tells me that she is likely dealing with psychological stress. Stress prompts an elevation in cortisol, which in turn stimulates the liver to drip more glucose into circulation. This tells me that we need to address her stress levels and probably also her sleep quality.

Not all carbs are created equal. The more refined the carb (think dinner roll, potato chips), the faster and higher the glucose spike. Less processed carbohydrates and those with more fiber, on the other hand, blunt the glucose impact. I try to eat more than fifty grams of fiber per day.

A good versus bad night of sleep makes a world of difference in terms of glucose control.

How much protein do we actually need? It varies from person to person. In my patients I typically set 1.6 g/kg/day as the minimum, which is twice the RDA. The ideal amount can vary from person to person, but the data suggest that for active people with normal kidney function, one gram per pound of body weight per day (or 2.2 g/kg/day) is a good place to start—nearly triple the minimal recommendation.

Do you need to eat meat, fish, and dairy to get sufficient protein? No. But if you choose to get all your protein from plants, you need to understand two things. First, the protein found in plants is there for the benefit of the plant, which means it is largely tied up in indigestible fiber, and therefore less bioavailable to the person eating it. Because much of the plant’s protein is tied to its roots, leaves, and other structures, only about 60 to 70 percent of what you consume is contributing to your needs, according to Don Layman, professor emeritus of food science and human nutrition at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and an expert on protein.

Olive oil and safflower oil might be as close as you can get to a pure monounsaturated fat, while palm and coconut oil might be as close as you can get to a pure saturated fat, but all foods that contain fats typically contain all three categories of fat: PUFA, MUFA, and SFA. Even a ribeye steak contains a lot of monounsaturated fats. So it’s not really possible or feasible to try to eliminate certain categories of fatty acids from the diet entirely; instead, we try to tweak the ratios.

Within PUFA, we make one more important distinction, which is to separate the omega-6 from the omega-3 variants (also a chemical distinction having to do with the position of the first double bond). We can further subdivide omega-3 PUFA into marine (EPA, DHA) and nonmarine sources (ALA). Salmon and other oil-rich seafood provide the former, nuts and flaxseed the latter.

As we discussed in the introduction to Medicine 3.0 and earlier in this chapter, any hope of using broad insights from evidence-based medicine is bound to fail when it comes to nutrition, because such population-level data cannot provide much value at the individual level when the effect sizes are so small, as they clearly are here. All Medicine 2.0 has to offer is broad contours: MUFA seems to be the “best” fat of the bunch (based on PREDIMED and the Lyon Heart study), and after that the meta-analyses suggest PUFA has a slight advantage over SFA.

There is no denying that some good things happen when we are not eating. Insulin drops dramatically because there are no incoming calories to trigger an insulin response. The liver is emptied of fat in fairly short order. Over time, within three days or so, the body enters a state called “starvation ketosis,” where fat stores are mobilized to fulfill the need for energy—yet at the same time, as I often noticed when I was undergoing regular lengthy fasts, hunger virtually disappears. This paradoxical phenomenon is likely due to the ultrahigh levels of ketones that this state produces, which tamp down feelings of hunger

Fasting over long periods also turns down mTOR, the pro-growth and pro-aging pathway we discussed in chapter 5. This would also be desirable, one might think, at least for some tissues. At the same time, lack of nutrients accelerates autophagy, the cellular “recycling” process that helps our cells become more resilient, and it activates FOXO, the cellular repair genes that may help centenarians live so long.

This cleansing process flushes out detritus, including both amyloid-beta and tau, the two proteins linked to neurodegeneration.

If you find yourself lying awake in bed, unable to get back to sleep, my advice is to stop fighting it. Get up, go into another room and do something relaxing. Fix a cup of tea (noncaffeinated, obviously), and read a (preferably boring) book until you feel sleepy again. The key, says Vikas Jain, is to find something that is relaxing and enjoyable but that serves no function; you never want to give your insomnia a purpose, such as doing work or paying bills, because if you do, your brain will make sure to wake you up for it on a regular basis.
