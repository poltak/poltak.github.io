As a language learner, or just someone who goes to Wikipedia articles a lot, I often see IPA characters (apparently they're actually called \"phonemes\" - more on that later). They are usually written between slashes, like these:\n<a href=\"https://memex.social/a/0isRyKVnJBqTnFNFadfO\">https://memex.social/a/0isRyKVnJBqTnFNFadfO</a></p>\n<p>Some of the characters used are familiar to us English speakers. Though often their sound may not be what we expect from common usage in English. There's also a whole bunch of characters that are not part of the Latin alphabet that we're familiar with at all.</p>\n<p>Anyway, if you tested me I wouldn't know how to pronounce many IPA characters. My knowledge is lacking. I don't have a huge reason to learn it, as the languages I am interested in learning don't really have the pronounciation ambiguities that arises from English spelling. In fact, they're all one-to-one. But curiosity compells me, and it just sounds fun.</p>\n<p>So I thought it would be nice if I could simply click on any IPA phenomes I come across on the net and have a recording of the pronounciation played for me.</p>\n<h2>How could this work?</h2>\n<p>Maybe the easiest way might be to write a context menu entry that you can click after you highlight some characters and it looks up the selection and autoplays whatever matches, nothing if no match.</p>\n<p>Something a bit more complex, but more useful, might be a content script that is loaded on each web-page, parsing it to see what IPA phonemes it encounters. Changing their HTML to make them clickable to play the matching pronounciation.</p>\n<p>IndexedDB would provide a nice way to store the recordings indexed via their phenome, or at least pointers to the stored recordings remotely or event bundled with the extension.</p>\n<p>UI and UX would be minimal, so most effort might go into figuring out what a nicely designed architecture to solve this problem might look like.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 10, 2020","slug":"/blog/ideas/ipa-web-ext-1","title":"My idea for a simple web ext"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/ideas/ipa-web-ext-1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1461116983","4105121369"]}
