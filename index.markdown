## What is this site?

This site is an online space for myself (Jonathan Poltak Samosir 林旭明) to:

- blog about my research
- keep an online version of my resume updated
- talk a little bit about myself (for those who are interested)
- play around with web technologies (when I actually have spare time)


## Technologies used

This site was created with the assistance of the following technologies:

- [GitHub Pages][2] (free hosting and version control)
- [Jekyll][3] (site management and static HTML generation)
- [Twitter Bootstrap][4] (to make it look like I know what I am doing with design)
- [Font Awesome][5] (to get those cute little icons)
- [Markdown][6] (so I can write in everyone's favourite mark-up language)
- [Disqus][7] (powers comments of the blog section of my site)
- [InstantClick][8] (for preloading of links)
- [Simple-Jekyll-Search][9] (for indexing my blog posts with a basic search bar)
- [Grunt][10] (for the automating of site build related tasks)


## Open source

The entire source for this site can be found in my site's [GitHub repo][1].

Feel free to criticize my code, send PRs, etc. Very new to web development, so open to suggestions.
