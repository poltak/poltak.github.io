## What is this site?

This site is an online space for myself to:

- occasionally write about things I find interesting
- keep an online version of my resume updated
- talk a little bit about myself (for those who are interested)
- play around with static site technologies, when I have spare time
</section>

## Technologies used

This site was created with the assistance of the following technologies:

- [GitHub Pages][2] (free hosting and version control)
- [Jekyll][3] (site management and static HTML generation)
- [Twitter Bootstrap][4] (to make it look like I know what I am doing with design)
- [Clean Blog Jekyll-Bootstrap theme][10]
- [Font Awesome][5] (to get those cute little icons)
- [Markdown][6] (so I can write content in everyone's favourite mark-up language)
- [Disqus][7] (powers comments of the blog section of my site)
- [Simple-Jekyll-Search][8] (for indexing my blog posts with a basic search bar)
- [Gulp][9] (for a simple asset build chain)
